<p>"We all know that student engagement is influenced by innumerable factors largely outside a school's control. But this finding suggests that there are some fundamental strategies schools can use to dramatically raise the likelihood that students will be emotionally engaged in the classroom on any given day.</p>

<p>To start, providing students with opportunities to discover and develop their talents should be a core practice in all schools. Imagine how engaged students would be if we devoted as much time and energy to students developing their strengths as we do to test preparation.</p>

<p>[The Howard County Public School System] trains teachers to spot students' strengths and help children pick short-term goals and long-term projects that will keep them excited. This focus on strengths-building is possible because these schools start by helping their teachers and administrators do what they do best."</p>

<p>The mission of the Howard County Public School System is to cultivate a vibrant learning community that prepares students to thrive in a dynamic world. Achieving this mission requires that HCPSS is aware of the perceptions of employees and students, and that each employee and student see HCPSS as a great place to work and learn. HCPSS launched a partnership with Gallup in 2013 to measure employee and student perceptions and uses this information to make further progress toward achieving the HCPSS mission.</p>

<p>Based on more than four decades of research, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/">Gallup</a> has identified definitive employee attitudes that correspond with the most successful workplaces. <a href="https://q12.gallup.com/Public/en-us/Features" target="_blank">Employee engagement &ndash; involvement with and enthusiasm for work &ndash; is measured by Gallup in a 12-question employee survey.</a> An employee's level of engagement links to various school outcomes, including employee retention, parent engagement, student retention, and student achievement. The employee engagement survey was conducted online from Oct. 14 through Oct. 28, 2013, with 6620 HCPSS employees registering their opinions (84% response rate).</p>

<p><a href="gallup-poll-2013.pdf">The Gallup Student Poll</a> is a 20-question survey that measures the hope, engagement, and well-being of students in grades 5&#8211;12. Research supports the idea that hope (ideas and energy for the future), engagement (involvement with and enthusiasm for school), and well-being (how we think about and experience our lives) are actionable targets linked to student achievement, retention, and future employment. The Gallup Student Poll was conducted online during the school day from Oct. 1 through Nov. 1, 2013, with 29,600 HCPSS students completing the survey.</p>

<p>Both of these surveys have yielded a wealth of data designed to inform HCPSS improvement efforts. Gallup has provided presentations for executive staff, principals, and central office managers. Gallup coaches and principals have had one-on-one conversations. Ongoing dialogue will continue with teams of employees across HCPSS as we continue to leverage insights from these data to drive success.</p>

<p>The results provide a comprehensive view of school-level data collected from the employee and student surveys. Please note the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>These data should be treated as a baseline measure. Future years will allow for comparison of current and previous year survey data.</li>
  <li>The employee survey results are reported at the school level, and also include the HCPSS districtwide results.</li>
  <li>The student survey results are shown at the school level, and also include HCPSS level-alike reports (e.g., all HCPSS high schools). The Gallup 2013 database results (a convenience sample of over 610,000 students from around the nation) are also presented.</li>
  <li>The student survey was conducted with students in grades 5&#8211;12. Although survey participation in the elementary schools is limited to students in the upper grades, discussions about student hope, engagement, and well-being apply to all students.</li>
</ul>

<p>These data are at the foundation of many important discussions and actions being taken throughout HCPSS. We look forward to leveraging insights from these results as we work to achieve our important mission.</p>
