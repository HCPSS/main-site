<h2>Maryland's 3-Tiered Instructional and PBIS Framework</h2>

<p>The Maryland Tiered Instructional and PBIS Framework organizes a continuum of evidence-based practices in which students experience instructional or behavioral supports that are based on their responsiveness to intervention. This three-tiered prevention logic requires that all students receive instructional and/or behavioral supports at the universal/green tier.</p>

<p>For students who are not responsive, more intensive instructional and/or behavioral supports are provided. Approximately 5-10% of the students will benefit from a small group targeted (yellow) intervention. An additional 1-5% may require a highly individualized intensive instructional and/or behavioral plan (red). The percentages are research-based estimates that represent the number of students who may require group or individual instructional  and/or behavioral interventions within a school environment.</p>
