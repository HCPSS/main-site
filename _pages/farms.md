<h2>Federal Income Guidelines</h2>

<img class="pict" src="/f/foodservice/food_pic5.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" />

<p>The HCPSS participates in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs. Students from households that meet federal income guidelines are eligible to receive  free or reduced-price meals. Those eligible for reduced-price meals pay 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. The listings below outlines the <a href="/food-services/farms/#chart">federal income eligibility guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Apply</h2>

<p>To apply for free or reduced-price meals, families should complete an <a href="https://www.applyforlunch.com/Application" target="_blank">Online Application</a><strong> OR </strong> complete, sign and return the paper application sent home on the first day of school.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.applyforlunch.com/Application" target="_blank">Apply Online.</a></strong> Once the online application has been submitted and reviewed, eligibility notifications will be sent to the email provided in the application.</p>

<p>(*Families that need computer or language assistance to apply online, please contact your child's school.)</p>

<p><strong>To apply using  a paper application</strong>, parents should complete all sections of the  application that is sent home with students on the first day of school. Once completed, applications can be  mailed to the Food and Nutrition Service Office (<a href="/food-services/farms/#address">mailing address</a>) or returned to your child's school for processing.</p>

<p>Once received, applications are privately scanned to retain confidentiality. If eligible for the FARMs program, notification will be mailed to your home through the U.S. postal service. Blank applications are also available at any HCPSS school or from the Food and Nutrition Service Office.</p>

<h2>Direct Certification (automatically eligible for FARMs)</h2>
<p>Every month a list of recipients  for social service benefits (ages 3 to 21) is received by the Food and Nutrition Service Office. The students on this direct certification list are automatically eligible to receive  free meals without submitting a FARMs application.</p>

<p>The Food and Nutrition Service Office will notify the families that their children have been approved and their children's names have been added to the cafeteria lunch roster. Once notification has been received,  students may obtain lunch by saying their first and last name to the person at  the end of the serving line. FARMs students are  treated the same as  prepaid students.</p>
