<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Music Education Program of the HPCSS prepares all students to meet the requirements of state and national music education standards in four broad areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perceiving and responding.</li>
  <li>Historical, cultural, and social context.</li>
  <li>Creative expression and production.</li>
  <li>Aesthetic criticism.</li>
</ul>

<p>All students in Grades 1-8 learn music through an articulated curriculum based on these four broad areas of development. At all levels, the goal of music education is to enable students to meet rigorous performance standards. This is accomplished by providing challenging curriculum, frequent assessments, and a stimulating learning environment to ensure that all students are afforded the opportunity to develop their own unique and special abilities.</p>

<h3>Middle School music education allows students to tune their interests in musical performance.</h3>

<p>Elective string instruction is available in Grades 3-12. Electives in wind and percussion instrumental instruction are offered in Grades 4-12. Even more options are available to high school students, who may elect to participate in both performance and non-performance music courses. Additional enrichment experiences such as attending a performance by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and participating in various local and regional festivals are available to extend the regular curriculum.</p>

<h3>High School music education provides a wide variety of performance and enrichment experiences for students to take advantage of.</h3>

<p>Music benefits the overall learning process of every child. Research reveals that more areas of the brain become active when children egage in playing music (Frank Wilson, 1999)*. Program effectiveness is determined through collection and interpretation of data, which shows continual improvement in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of students in advanced courses.</li>
  <li>The number of students who qualify for after-school and Gifted and Talented ensembles.</li>
  <li>Participation and achievement in festivals and adjudications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>The Music Education Program of HCPSS is a vital component of the total education a student receives. Through the study of music, all students develop knowledge and skills that prepare them to experience the power of music in human existence. Students discover music as a unique form of communication and as a means of self-expression not afforded by any other discipline. They learn of the universal role of music in the transmission of culture and the chronicling of history.</p>

<p>The study of music gives children a broadened world vision and an appreciation of other points of view. As a performing art, music builds self-discipline and promotes self-esteem in ways that are not inherent in other curricular offerings. Because of the ordered nature of the elements of music, students learn to think with increased complexity; because of the creative potential in music, they learn to think in divergent ways.</p>
