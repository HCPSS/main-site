<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>Newly proposed instructional materials are presented to the Board of Education (BOE) in December by the Curricular Programs Office. In compliance with <a href="/f/board/policies/8040.pdf">Policy 8040 <img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>, Selection of Instructional Materials, the proposed instructional materials are placed on display for 15 days in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=10910+Clarksville+Pike,+Ellicott+City,+MD+21042&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Department of Education lobby</a> <img alt="new webpage" src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" border="0" /> following the December board meeting.</p>

<p>The public may review and make comments regarding the proposed instructional materials during this time. Final approval of the proposed instructional materials by the BOE occurs at the February meeting.</p>

<p>The approved materials are then added to the Approved Instructional Materials List. Questions related to any of the approved instructional materials should be directed to the appropriate curriculum coordinator.</p>
