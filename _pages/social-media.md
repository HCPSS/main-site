<h2>Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/HCPSS" target="_blank">@HCPSS</a>)</h2>

<p>Go here for news and information, with a focus on our students and schools. We tweet about events and activities from both the school system and our schools. More focused on the students, we tweet about events for youth, scholarship opportunities, testing information and more. We run various social media campaigns through our Twitter site, including #GirlsAsLeaders and #HCPSSDreamBig.</p>
