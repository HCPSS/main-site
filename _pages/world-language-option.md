<p>Middle school students have the option to take a world language beginning in seventh grade. The middle school World Language Program provides instruction in French or Spanish every day in Grades 7 and 8 during one of the Related Arts periods.</p>

<p>Students who successfully complete the World Language Program in Grades 7 and 8 will have that accomplishment recorded on their high school transcript. World language study in Grades 7 and 8 enables students to pursue world language study through the Advanced Placement level in high school.</p>

<p>The selection of world language study at the middle school level is a two-year commitment. When considering the world language option in middle school, students and parents should carefully weigh the workload of this additional class and the loss of participation in the Related Arts cycle.</p>

<p>World languages are taught using a proficiency-based approach. This means that the focus is on what students know and can do in the language. Instruction is primarily in the world language for approximately 90 to 100 percent of the class time. Students engage in reading, writing, speaking and listening to the language, which includes active participation in and out of class.</p>

<p>French and Spanish are available in all middle schools. Chinese, French and Spanish are an option for 6th graders entering Mt. View and Murray Hill Middle Schools in the 2013-14 school as a continuation of the Elementary World Language Pilot.</p>
