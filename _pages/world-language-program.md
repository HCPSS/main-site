<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The World Language Program prepares students to participate in a multilingual environment that values other cultures. It incorporates a proficiency-based curriculum that enables students to use the world language in real-life situations. The program is designed to stimulate cognitive development and to help students improve skills in their first language. Research supports this approach; children who study a world language show greater mental flexibility, creativity, divergent thinking, and higher order thinking skills. The study of a language also enhances listening skills and memory. The development of these skills supports preparation for college and career readiness.</p>
