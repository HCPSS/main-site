<h2><a name="school_care"></a>Before and After School Care</h2>
<p>Before and After Care is offered at all Howard County public elementary schools and some middle schools. Care is provided by the Columbia Association (410-715-3100) or the Department of Recreation and Parks (410-313-4651).</p>

<h2><a name="attend"></a>Attendance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>By state law, children must attend school from ages 5 to 15. The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) has defined full and partial day attendance as follows:</li>
  <li>A student is counted present for a full day if the student is in attendance four hours or more of the school day.</li>
  <li>A student is counted present for half day if the student is in attendance for at least two hours of the school day, but less than four hours.</li>
  <li>A student scheduled for less than a full day is to be counted present based on the amount of time he/she is scheduled.</li>
  <li>A note from the parent must be submitted to the school within two school days of the student's return, indicating the date and reason for tardiness or absence from a regular school session. A doctor's certificate is required in cases of long-term absence due to illness. A note should also be submitted to request early dismissal or exclusion from activities (e.g., physical education). Chronic absences are referred to the Office of Student Services.  <a href="/board/policies/9000-series/">See Student Reponsibility Policy 9010 for more information.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="bus"></a>Bus Transportation</h2>
<p>The Department of Education provides bus transportation for all elementary and middle school students who live more than one mile from their assigned school, and for high school students who live more than one and one-half miles from their assigned school. Transportation services are provided for certain students with disabilities depending upon their special needs and school assignment.</p>

<p>Students are expected to exercise safe behavior on school buses and to adhere to the following rules which are posted on each bus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow directions from the driver the first time they are given.</li>
  <li>Stay seated in your seat at all times while the bus is in motion.</li>
  <li>Keep all parts of your body inside the bus.</li>
  <li>Keep hands, feet, legs, arms, personal property and your voice to yourself.</li>
  <li>No eating, smoking, drinking or vulgar language at any time on the bus.</li>
  <li>Unsafe behavior on the bus may result in temporary or permanent loss of riding privileges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cameras are used on school buses for behavior management. Video and audio recordings are maintained in the Pupil Transportation Office. For more information, please call 410-313-6732.</p>

<h2><a name="meals"></a>Meals</h2>
<p>Lunch and breakfast are available at all schools. Each meal is planned to be nutritionally balanced and provide one-third of the daily requirements of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, protein and fat. Parents may purchase a meal plan to ensure that their child gets a balanced, nutritious lunch and/or breakfast every day without having to carry cash.</p>

<p>Students from households that meet federal income guidelines are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. To apply, families should complete the application sent home on the first day of school, sign it, and return it to the school, or mail it to the Food and Nutrition Service Office (address on application) or parents can apply online at <a href="https://www.applyforlunch.com/" target="_blank">www.applyforlunch.com</a>. School lunch menus, meal plans and nutrition information are available at <a href="/food-services/">the food services webpage</a>. Contact the Food and Nutrition Service Office at 410-313-6738.</p>

<h2><a name="homework"></a>Homework Guidelines</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that each student meets or exceeds rigorous performance and achievement standards, Howard County public schools must assist students in maintaining and extending their learning. The appropriate design, use, and evaluation of regular homework assignments are all integral pieces needed to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Throughout all grades, teachers will provide homework that is engaging, varied, and that meets the needs of the individual learner as well as the subject matter. Homework can help students reinforce previously taught skills, explore and extend knowledge, prepare for future lessons, challenge and inspire independent learning, and explore new talents and skills. It must be useful, responsive, engaging, varied and challenging. Homework also enables parents to take an active role in their child's education by monitoring academic progress and reinforcing lessons at home. All Howard County schools develop and implement a set of comprehensive homework guidelines based upon countywide criteria as well as on the needs of that school's community.</p>

<p>Homework guidelines incorporate the following criteria:</p>

<h3>All Grades</h3>
<p>Individual schools will need to provide information to parents on the school's, team's, and teacher's homework guidelines, the student's homework responsibilities, and how parents can help monitor, assist, and discuss homework. Each school will communicate this information clearly to parents at the beginning of every school year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teachers will review homework and provide feedback to students in a timely manner.</li>
  <li>Homework should be planned so that students see the relationship of their homework to classwork, see meaning in their assignments, have a clear understanding of the procedures and due dates, and understand how their homework is evaluated.</li>
  <li>Each school will develop clear guidelines for dealing with late or missing homework, as well as determine the percentage of grades that can be derived from homework assignments.</li>
  <li>Homework will be differentiated to meet the needs of individual students and curricula.</li>
  <li>Homework may be reviewed or evaluated as part of class activities; however, class time should not be used for the completion of homework.</li>
  <li>Homework patterns should change to help prepare students for the transition to the types and amount of homework they will receive as they move from elementary school to middle school to high school.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grades K-5</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately one to five hours of homework a week are suggested for elementary school students. Homework assignments usually reinforce previously taught skills, and may prepare students for future lessons, promote creativity, and/or be a reflection on the student's day at school.</li>
  <li>County and state mandated testing are legitimate reasons for modifying homework assignments.</li>
  <li>Elementary school students may have more than one teacher. Therefore, teams of teachers need to coordinate activities and projects so that reasonable amounts of homework are given across subjects each night, and so that opportunities for integrating subjects are maximized.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grades 6-8</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately five to 10 hours of homework a week are suggested for middle school students. Homework assignments may reinforce previously taught skills, prepare students for future lessons, extend learning, promote creativity, and/or be a reflection on the student's day at school.</li>
  <li>County and state mandated testing are legitimate reasons for modifying homework assignments.</li>
  <li>Middle school students have more than one teacher. Therefore, teams of teachers need to coordinate activities and projects so that reasonable amounts of homework are given across subjects each night, and so that opportunities for integrating subjects are maximized.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grades 9-12</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately seven to 15 hours of homework a week are suggested for high school students, recognizing that some classes might require them to spend more or less time than is typical. Homework assignments may reinforce previously taught skills, prepare students for future lessons, extend learning, promote creativity, and/or be a reflection on the student's day at school.</li>
  <li>County and state mandated testing, and exam weeks are legitimate reasons for modifying homework assignments.</li>
  <li>A syllabus is recommended for distribution at the beginning of every semester outlining each course's requirements; including homework assignments, projects, possible due dates, and procedures for requesting feedback on assignments.</li>
  <li>High school students have more than one teacher. Therefore, teams of teachers need to coordinate activities and projects so that reasonable amounts of homework are given across subjects each night, and so that opportunities for integrating subjects are maximized.</li>
  <li>There will be no mandatory homework given over the summer. Any work assigned over the summer will be voluntary and non-graded enrichment activities. Reading lists will be available during the summer, as well as throughout the school year, as a service to students who want an opportunity to work ahead.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="personal_prop"></a>Students' Personal Property</h2>
<p>Students are responsible for personal property brought into a school, on school grounds, school-sponsored events such as a field trip, or on a school bus. This includes items that are relevant to instructional programs or extracurricular activities, such as musical instruments. Storage for these items is limited at schools. Students should not ask school staff to hold or store a personal item for a period of time.</p>

<p>Students are strongly discouraged from bringing items of significant sentimental and/or monetary value to school. Students who store items in a locker or other school-provided areas do so voluntarily, and are responsible for the security of any keys or combinations in their possession. The school system will not be responsible for lost or stolen items.</p>

<p>School staff have the right to confiscate cell phones and electronic devices seen during the school day, and school administrators have the right to require a parent to pick up the confiscated device. School personnel also may confiscate personal property if its possession or use on school grounds or at school events violates system policies or school rules. The property will be returned to the student's parent/guardian after a parent conference. Substances or items that are illegal to possess, will be given to law enforcement officials or retained for disciplinary proceedings. Staff will take reasonable precautions to protect the property until dispersal is determined. Parents who have questions or a claim regarding lost or damaged student property, should contact Safety, Environment and Risk Management at 410-313-6739.</p>

<h2><a name="photo"></a>Photographing, Videotaping or Audiotaping in Schools with Cell or Smart Phones</h2>
<p>Parents have a right to expect a certain level of protection and privacy for their children while they are in the care of the Howard County Public School System. As a protective measure, parents and others who are not school employees who intend to photograph, videotape or audiotape students in school or on school grounds during the regular instructional day using smart phones, cell phone or other devices must have prior approval from the building administrator. This does not apply to photographing, videotaping or audiotaping during extracurricular activities, such as public concerts and athletic events.</p>

<p>Classrooms, lunchrooms, etc. are not open public property and the principal has the right to control public access. Individuals who violate these guidelines will receive an initial warning. Repeat violations may result in the issue of a no trespassing letter.</p>

<h2><a name="religion"></a>Accommodations for Religious Observance</h2>
<p>The Board of Education recognizes the diversity of religious traditions represented among the staff and students of the Howard County Public School System and the value such diversity adds to the educational program. The Board respects the religious practices of staff and students and is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for religious obligations.</p>

<p>Parents must complete the Absence for Religious Obligation form and submit the request to the principal/designee documenting the need for the accommodation. Requests should be submitted, whenever possible, at the beginning of the school year, but no later than two weeks in advance of the request. If the student's absence is approved, the absence will be considered a lawful absence either for the day or any portion of the day.</p>

<p>A student may make up work and receive a recorded grade when an absence for religious observance is approved. This includes opportunities to make up any missed tests or assignments.</p>

<p>If the Absence for Religious Obligation form is not completed prior to the student's absence, the absence may be coded as unexcused.</p>

<p>Students who complete the school year with no absences, other than those resulting from religious obligation, will not be denied school attendance certificates where such are regularly awarded.</p>

<p>The policies of the Howard County Public School System related to religious observance apply to student participation in athletic practices and games,as well as other extracurricular activities.</p>

<p>Students are excused from attendance at, or participation in, any extracurricular activity when their attendance or participation conflicts with their religious observance.Athletic practices and events are optional for students on any religious holiday.</p>

<h3>School Holidays</h3>
<p>Maryland State School Law requires that public schools be closed on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thanksgiving Day and the day after</li>
  <li>Christmas Eve through January 1</li>
  <li>Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</li>
  <li>Presidents' Day</li>
  <li>The Friday before Easter through the Monday after Easter</li>
  <li>Memorial Day</li>
  <li>Primary and General Election Days</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the school system is also closed on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="/board/policies/9000-series/">Policies 9010, Attendance,</a> and <a href="/board/policies/3000-series/">3000, Religious Observances.</a></p>

<h2><a name="resolve"></a>Resolving School Concerns and Disagreements</h2>
<p>Parents, families and community members have a vital role in ensuring school success. Therefore, the school system supports parental, family and community involvement in the educational process. There will be times when a parent, guardian or custodian may need to ask school system employees to address a concern. This document outlines the steps for responding to parental school-based concerns so that inquiries or problems are resolved as quickly and satisfactorily as possible.</p>

<p>The school system has both informal and formal processes for responding to parental inquiries and concerns. Exceptions to these procedures are noted for issues where an alternative process is specifically provided by statute or other regulation.*</p>

<p>When issues arise, parents are encouraged to direct their concerns to the persons most closely involved. However, when the informal process fails to provide resolution, a parent may file a formal complaint and seek review at a higher administrative level. In both processes, the intent is to protect the confidentiality and preserve the dignity of everyone involved.</p>

<p>The Ombudsman for the Board of Education, who serves as a neutral party in the resolution of concerns or conflicts, is available to assist the parent, family or community member at any point in this process.</p>

<h3>Informal Process</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The first level in resolving concerns and issues is to address them with the school staff member who is most closely and directly involved. Through a process of cooperative agreement, the individuals can usually reach a mutually effective resolution.</li>
 <li>The second level in resolving the concerns in the informal process is to contact a member of the school's administrative team. The administrator will take into consideration the needs of all parties as well as all applicable HCPSS policies and procedures.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>a. The administrator will confirm that the parent has attempted to resolve the issue or concern with the classroom teacher or other school-based staff member, when appropriate.</li>
  <li>b. If the concern requires the involvement of other Central Office departments, the administrator will assist the parent in accessing the appropriate office and provide a synopsis of the concern to that office (e.g., transportation, special education, curriculum, food services). Central Office personnel will respond to the parent within 10 school days and inform the principal of the response.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Formal Process</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The first level in the formal process is to outline specific concerns by completing Part I of the Parent Concern Form and submit this form to the principal.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>a. The principal will contact the parent within three school days to arrange a mutually agreed upon meeting date and time.</li>
   <li>b. The principal will formally document any agreements that are made at the meeting. The principal will follow up the meeting by completing Part II of the Parent Concern Form, summarizing the outcome of the meeting, identifying areas of agreement, and laying out steps to address any issues still unresolved. This response will be sent within 10 school days from the date of the meeting.</li>
   <li>If a concern cannot be reasonably resolved within the 10 school days, the principal may extend the time for not more than 10 additional school days. The parent will be informed of the extension in writing.</li>
   <li>c. The parent will sign and return the Parent Concern Form. Signing indicates receipt of the form.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>  

<p>If the issue is not resolved satisfactorily, or the concern directly involves the principal, the parent can contact the appropriate Administrative Director in the Division of Instruction to review the concern. The Administrative Director will request the principal to forward copies of all applicable documentation to the Central Office, including the Parent Concern Form. Parents may also submit applicable documentation.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The second level in the formal process is a review by the appropriate Administrative Director. Upon receipt of the Parent Concern Form and applicable documentation, the Administrative Director will:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>a. Contact the parent.</li>
   <li>b. Confer with the parent, principal, and other appropriate staff members regarding the concern.</li>
   <li>c. Document any decisions or agreements made and respond in writing to the parent within 10 school days of receipt of the request, and forward copies to the principal.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>If the parent is not satisfied with the decision of the Administrative Director, the parent may request that the matter be reviewed by the Executive Director, School Improvement and Administration, who serves as the Superintendent's designee. A parent desiring this review must submit a written request to the Executive Director explaining the concern and clearly stating the outcome or relief desired by the parent. The Executive Director, School Improvement and Administration, will review the documentation and provide a written response to the parent's request within 15 school days of receipt of the request.</p>

<p>*Note: Specific information can be obtained from the schools or the Public Information Office at the Department of Education regarding the formal process for addressing issues specifically governed by regulation or Board of Education policy, including requests for reasonable accommodations or modifications under the Americans for Disabilities Act, special education appeals, appeals of student suspensions/expulsions or other administrative actions, equity assurance concerns or discrimination complaints, and requests for information under the Maryland Public Information Act.</p>

<h2><a name="ombudsman"></a>Ombudsman</h2>
<p>The Board of Education of Howard County believes that an Ombudsman can facilitate positive relationships among the Board of Education, school system employees, and the public. The Ombudsman serves as a neutral party to collaborate with Howard County Department of Education staff and the community to resolve concerns in an equitable and timely manner.</p>

<h3>Services of the Ombudsman include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Confidential discussion of your concern (consistent with law).</li>
  <li>Research of applicable school system information.</li>
  <li>Review of applicable Board of Education policies and procedures.</li>
  <li>Referral to individuals who can help solve the problem.</li>
  <li>Referral to appropriate school system and community resources.</li>
  <li>Assistance with the Problem Resolution Process (See previous section, Resolving School Concerns and Complaints).</li>
  <li>Facilitation of communication/discussion as needed.</li>
  <li>Assistance accessing formal processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ombudsman must follow Board of Education and HCPSS policies and procedures, and treat all parties fairly (<a href="/board/policies/2000-series/">See Policy 2030: Ombudsman</a>). The Ombudsman does not act as an advocate for either side in a dispute and does not decide who is "innocent" or who is "guilty." The Ombudsman does not have the authority to change policy or force schools to take specific action. However, the Ombudsman will listen, review your situation, and assist with the timely and equitable resolution of your concerns.</p>
