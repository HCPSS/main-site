<p>The Black Student Achievement Program (BSAP) assists HCPSS in closing the achievement gap evident in the patterns of data between black students and the student population at large. Over the years the BSAP, established in 1986, has been a valuable resource to the school system, black students, their parents and the community. Through a coordinated system of services, BSAP guides black students to develop education, career and personal/social competencies.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal of the BSAP is to help black students excel as leaders and conquer the challenges of the 21st century. To this end, the BSAP assists the HCPSS in implementing the <a href="/aboutus/bridge-to-excellence/">Bridge to Excellence</a> Five-Year Master Plan.
