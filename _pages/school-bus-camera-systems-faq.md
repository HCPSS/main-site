<h2>How many cameras are being installed?</h2>
<p>During the 2013 calendar year, HCPSS will equip 211 buses with camera systems. They will be installed on newer buses first, as well as where school administrators have deemed them most beneficial.</p>

<p>Each four camera system includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>two cameras in the front of bus (one facing the steps)</li>
  <li>one camera in the middle of the bus</li>
  <li>one camera in the rear of the bus.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ultimate goal is to outfit all 439 buses with camera systems within the next few years.</p>

<h2>What does each camera system cost?</h2>
<p>The camera system costs $1450 per bus.</p>

<h2>When will they be installed?</h2>
<p>Cameras have been installed in approximately 100 buses already. It is our goal to have the remaining 111 buses equipped by the end of the 2013 calendar year.

<h2>How do the cameras work?</h2>
<p>The cameras, which record both audio and video, have 500 GB hard drives, which last approximately three weeks before being overwritten. Recording begins when the bus is turned on, and ends five minutes after the bus is turned off.</p>

<h2>Who has access to the recordings?</h2>
<p>Hard drives are in a locked box and may be only retrieved by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HCPSS Transportation Director and/or Area Managers</li>
  <li>Authorized school building administrator</li>
</ul>

<p>Recorded material may only be reviewed by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transportation staff members</li>
  <li>Central Office executive staff</li>
  <li>School security</li>
  <li>Risk management</li>
  <li>Accident review committee</li>
  <li>School administrators</li>
  <li>School Resource Officers</li>
</ul>

<h2>What will the recordings be used for?</h2>
<p>Camera recordings are not monitored and only will be accessed when staff believe it necessary to assist in an investigation.</p>

<h2>How does this help anti-bullying efforts?</h2>
<p>The camera installations support the recommendations of the Joint Task Force on School Safety. They will supplement HCPSS' current processes for addressing complaints of bullying behavior.</p>

<p>School administrators will be able to access these recordings when complaints or problems occur. This will help administrators get to the bottom of the incident, quickly and objectively.</p>
