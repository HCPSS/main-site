<p>The Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessments are computer adaptive achievement test in Mathematics and Reading. As a student responds to questions, the test responds to the student, adjusting up or down the difficulty of the questions presented to the student.</p>

<p>During the 2013-2014 school year, the HCPSS is using the MAP assessment at 19 elementary schools and all middle schools. MAP will be used in all elementary and middle schools during the 2014-2015 school year. Students are assigned one of three versions of MAP based on grade level: MAP for Primary Grades (MPG), MAP 2-5, or MAP 6+. In order to track growth during the school year, students in grades 1 through 8 are assessed two or three times: in the beginning (fall), in the middle (winter), and at the end of the school year (spring).</p>

<p>Currently, the HCPSS is working to better understand how we can use MAP assessments to improve teaching and learning. The HCPSS will use MAP as one of several measures to help us assess student learning. Along with other data sources, MAP helps us to determine instructional strengths and needs for HCPSS schools and individual students.</p>

<p>MAP is unique among the assessments the HCPSS currently uses because it allows one to look at student growth throughout the school year and across school years.</p>
