<p>Title I is a federally funded program designed to ensure that all children have an opportunity to access a high quality education. The goal of this federal program is to close the achievement gap for all students. There are two types of Title I programs in Howard County: Targeted Assistance School programs (TAS) and Schoolwide Title I programs. Schools are identified and authorized to implement one of these programs based on the percentage of students receiving free and/or reduced meals.</p>

<p>The <strong>Targeted Assistance School program</strong> (TAS) allows Title I teachers to provide services to a select group of children. Title I funds may only be used to provide services to children who are identified as having the greatest need for educational assistance.</p>

<p>The <strong>Schoolwide program</strong> allows all students to be eligible for additional academic support. Federal funds are used to support and enhance the overall school program. Title I funds may be used to upgrade the entire school's educational program so that the overall education of ALL children who attend the school can be improved.</p>
