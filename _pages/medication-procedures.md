<h2>Medication Defined</h2>

<p>Medication includes ALL prescribed drugs and ALL over-the-counter medication prescribed by an authorized prescriber. Otherwise, over-the-counter medications may not be used in any school.</p>

<h2>Administering Medication</h2>

<p>The taking or administering of medication during school hours is discouraged. Ideally, all medication should be given at home. If a student is to receive medication for a period of time, arrangements should be made to have it administered either before or after school hours whenever possible.</p>

  <li><a href="#trips"> Medication Administration During School-Sponsored Activities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is recognized, however, that students with chronic disabilities or illnesses may require medication if they are to remain in school. Students should have medication available and administered in a manner consistent with school health services procedures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Students are not allowed to carry any medication without an order.</li>
  <li>A complete written and signed order from the prescribing physician, dentist, or nurse practitioner (NP, PNP, or FNP) must accompany all medication to be administered.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medication Forms</h2>

</ul>

<h3>New Forms are required for:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A change of medication.</li>
  <li>A change in form (e.g. liquid to tablet).</li>
  <li>A change of dosage.</li>
  <li>A change in time of administration.</li>
  <li>Each school year (Orders must be dated on or after July 1 of the current year).</li>
  <li>Reinstating the administration of medication after a four week or more period of omission requested by the parent/guardian.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="trips"></a> Medication Administration During School-Sponsored Activities</h2>

<p>Medication administered during any school-sponsored activity must be administered according to the Maryland State School Health Services Guidelines/Administration of Medication in Schools and HCPSS Medication Administration Procedure.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/schools/health-services/day-field-trip-medication-procedures/">School Day Field Trip</a></li>
  <li><a href="/schools/health-services/extended-day-trip-medication-procedures/">Extended Day Field Trip</a></li>
  <li><a href="/schools/health-services/overnight-field-trip-medication-procedures/">Overnight Field Trip</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Medication should be administered to students on school-sponsored trips only when absolutely necessary. Timing of doses should be adjusted to occur before or after the school sponsored activity if medically appropriate. A medication order form completed by a physician/prescriber is required for all medications, i.e., prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), homeopathic and herbal. Written consent of the parent/guardian for the administration of medication is required. Administration of OTC, homeopathic, and herbal medicines must be conducted in accordance with the procedures for prescription medication.</p>

<p>The determination of whether a medication is administered during a school-sponsored activity and by whom should be determined by the cluster nurse or school nurse in collaboration with the school administrator and parent/guardians.</p>

<p>Students cannot be excluded from participation in school-sponsored activities because of the need for medication.</p>
