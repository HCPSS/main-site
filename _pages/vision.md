<p>We envision a dynamic and responsive learning community of general and special education for students with disabilities where</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone is united in a common commitment to ensuring success for each child</li>
  <li>Children have access to general education curriculum with high expectations and standards to create a better future for themselves and others</li>
  <li>Everyone works together to set and achieve the highest possible standards, both academic and behavioral, and to be accountable for results</li>
  <li>There is a shared understanding among all staff, students, and families of expectations, roles, and responsibilities</li>
  <li>Special education processes are participant friendly and promote collaboration with a focus on the needs of the child</li>
  <li>Parents and children are heard and understood, and their input is valued</li>
  <li>All staff are valued, as professionals, for their knowledge, experience, and competence</li>
  <li>Supports and resources are provided to schools, staff, students, and families to meet the assessed needs of children</li>
  <li>A comprehensive range of instructional services is available</li>
  <li>Staff and families are supported and best practices are promoted through comprehensive staff development and family training opportunities</li>
  <li>Services are coordinated with community resources to support children and their families.</li>
</ul>
