<h2><a name="eligibility"></a>School Eligibility Requirements</h1>

<h3>Age of Entrance</h3>
<p>Children must be five years of age on or before September 1 to enter kindergarten. Parents may request to hold their child back one year by submitting a kindergarten waiver form or to have their child assessed in order to gain early admission. </p>

<h3>Residency</h3>
<p>A child is eligible to attend a Howard County public school if his/her parents or guardians are residents of Howard County. A child must attend the school in the attendance area in which he/she lives. Tuition will be charged retroactively, if, upon investigation, it is determined that a student was enrolled as a resident student, but lacked bona fide residency. If the student does not currently qualify for enrollment under Policy 9000, the student will be withdrawn. For more information, please contact the Public Information Office at 410-313-6682 or use the <a href="https://hcpss2.securesites.net/SchoolLocator/index.jsp" target="_blank">School Locator</a>.</p>

<h3>Physical Examination Requirement</h3>
<p>Maryland law requires a physical examination for all students entering a Maryland public school for the first time. The required physical examination form is available at each school. If your child has a temporary or chronic health problem, please notify the school health assistant or nurse.</p>

<h2><a name="ES"></a>Elementary School: PreK-Grade 5</h2>      

<h3>Pre-K</h3>
<p>The Pre-K program is a state and locally funded half-day program for four-year-old students. Students must be four years old by September 1 to be considered for the program. The main purpose of the program is to provide a high-quality preschool experience for identified youngsters.</p>   

<p>The Maryland State Department of Education requires that the Pre-K program be available first for targeted students. Therefore, eligibility requirements, mainly economic status, are used to determine which students are offered the program. For more information on the Pre-K program, including eligibility requirements and locations, visit <a href="/schools/pre-k-programs/">www.hcpss.org/schools/prek</a> or call 410-313-5693.</p>

<h3>Kindergarten-Grade 5</h3>
<p>Children must be five years of age on or before September 1 to enter kindergarten. In kindergarten through grade 5, students receive instruction in Language Arts,  Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and Health. Students are taught in whole and small groups designed to meet their specific instructional needs.</p>     
<p>Elementary students also take classes in Physical Education, Music, Art, Library/Media and Technology, weekly.</p>

<h2><a name="MS"></a>Middle School: Grades 6-8</h2>
<p>Middle school students take English Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics and Science, as well as related arts classes, which include Physical Education, Health, Art, General Music, and Performing Arts. Students may also choose to take Band, Orchestra, Chorus or a World Language. Some students may also take additional related arts classes including Technology Education, Family and Consumer Sciences (FACS), GT Research and/or Seminars, Innovation and Inquiry Reading modules, or Mathematics/Reading Interventions/Seminars. </p> 
  
<p>Students who successfully complete the World Language Program in middle school will have that accomplishment recorded on their high school transcript. World language study in middle school enables students to pursue world language study through the Advanced Placement level in high school.</p>

<p>The selection of world language study is a multi-year commitment in middle school. When considering the world language option in middle school, students and parents should carefully weigh the workload of this additional class and the loss of participation in the Related Arts cycle.</p> 

<p>French and Spanish are available in all middle schools. Chinese is an additional option for 6th graders entering Mount View and Murray Hill middle schools as a continuation of the Elementary World Language Pilot.</p>   

<p>Middle school students who take high school level courses, such as Algebra, must take and pass the appropriate High School Assessment; those scores count toward their graduation requirements.</p>

Beginning in this school year, students entering Grade 9 or below must take the HSAs for algebra/data analysis, biology, English, and government as they complete the associated courses. All students are required to pass all four tests or meet other criteria established by MSDE to receive a Maryland diploma. For more information, see Policy 8030.</p>

<h3><a name="academies"></a>Career Academies</h3> 
<p>The school system offers a broad range of Career Academies that prepare high school students for college and careers. Career Academies are available in the following Career Clusters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arts, Media and Communication </li>
  <li>Business, Management and Finance </li>
  <li>Career Research and Development</li>
  <li>Construction and Development </li>

  <li>Health and Biosciences</li>
  <li>Human Resources Services </li>
  <li>Information Technology </li>
  <li>Manufacturing, Engineering and Technology </li>
  <li>Transportation Technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each Career Cluster are Career Academies that will prepare students for specific career pathways.</p>

<p>See the Career Academies section in the Catalog of Approved High School Courses for guidance on course selection, academy prerequisites, special requirements, and information needed to complete each Career Academy program.</p>

<p>Academy students may participate in special activities and events that provide greater awareness of the specific career area and opportunities within that area. Participating students become part of a small group of students with similar interests completing courses together.</p>

<p>Any student may be part of a Career Academy. He/she should discuss options with the school counselor. Students may join an academy up to the end of tenth grade, as long as all applicable prerequisites are met.</p>

<p>Some academies are located in each local high school, while others are located at the Applications and Research Lab (ARL). If the Career Academy is located at the high school, all coursework will be taught at the school. Students who participate in an academy located at the ARL will complete all academic and prerequisite coursework at their local high school and will complete the junior and senior level academy courses at the ARL. Bus transportation is provided to and from the ARL. </p>

<p>For more information, students should contact their guidance counselor. Parents may call the Office of Career and Technology Education at 410-313-6629.</p>

<h2>High School Student Activities</h2>

<h3><a name="acad_eligibility"></a>Academic Eligibility for High School Extracurricular Activities </h3>  
<p>(See <a href="/board/policies/9000-series/">Policy 9070</a> for complete information.)</p>

<p>The Board of Education has established academic criteria that must be met by all high school students to participate in school-sponsored extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are activities available to students beyond the regular school day, which are voluntary and not required for the satisfactory completion of a particular class. This policy governs minimum academic eligibility for student participation in all extracurricular activities for which there is an HCPSS contracted coach/sponsor. There are no academic eligibility standards for participation in extracurricular activities when participation is required as part of a course and for clubs and activities with a sponsor not contracted by HCPSS.</p>  

<p>For high school, a full-time student earns academic eligibility to participate in extracurricular activities, including athletics, by maintaining a 2.0 weighted grade-point average (GPA), calculated using credit or non-credit courses, with no more than one failing grade for the marking period that governs eligibility for that activity. This provision does not apply to incoming 9th grade students for fall eligibility. Incomplete grades must be converted to a letter grade to determine eligibility (Policy 8020 Grading and Reporting: High School). If a student withdraws from a course, the grades at the time of withdrawal will be used in determining academic eligibility.</p>

<p>Each extracurricular activity is governed by only one marking period. A student must have earned academic eligibility prior to the start of the activity as determined by the last report card. Once academic eligibility has been earned for a particular activity, the student remains academically eligible for the duration of that activity season (e.g., basketball season). Eligibility is reviewed at the end of each successive marking period for yearlong activities or activities that do not have a particular time frame.</p>

<p>A student who plans to participate in athletics and his/her parent are responsible for certifying the student's academic eligibility by signing a Howard County Public School System participation form prior to participation. Athletic coaches are responsible for verifying the academic eligibility of each athlete participating on their team(s) prior to the first practice session. Contracted sponsors of other extracurricular activities are responsible for verifying the academic eligibility of each participating student prior to the first activity.</p>

<h3><a name="interscholastic"></a>Interscholastic Athletics</h3>
<p>Student Eligibility</h3>

<p>Student eligibility for high school athletics is governed by State regulations, COMAR 13A.06.03. These regulations are implemented by The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA), which establishes procedures for regular season sports programs and state tournaments. In addition, each school district may adopt more restrictive rules for their own programs, including participation standards to ensure that student athletes are making satisfactory progress toward graduation, per COMAR 13A.06.03.01-02.</p>

<p>In general, high school students may participate in interscholastic sports upon the consent of their parents and guardians and after being found physically fit by a qualified physician. Student athletes must maintain amateur status, and may participate on teams outside schools if membership on the outside team does not conflict with participation in the school program.  Participants must be registered at the MPSSAA member high school where they play, and may participate a maximum of three seasons in any one sport in Grades 10, 11, 12, or four seasons if the student began participating in the sport in Grade 9.  Students 19 years old or older and high school graduates are ineligible, per COMAR 13A.06.03.02.</p>

<h3>Equal Opportunity</h3>
<p>Students may not be excluded on the basis of sex or disability from overall equal opportunity to participate in athletic programs, per COMAR 13A.06.03.04(A), COMAR 13A.06.04.03(B)</p>

<h3>Violations, Penalties, and Appeals</h3>
<p>A student who violates interscholastic sports regulations will be penalized by having his or her eligibility to participate suspended.  The length of the suspension is determined by the number of violations committed by the student, and for three or more violations, additional penalties may also be imposed, per COMAR 13A.06.03.05(A).</p>

<p>A student found in violation may appeal the penalty and request a hearing before the Appeals Committee of the MPSSAA. The decision of the Appeals Committee may also be taken to the State Superintendent who may, on a discretionary basis, appoint a special committee to uphold, deny, or modify the appeal. The decision of the special committee is final, per COMAR 13A.06.03.05(B).</p>

<h3><a name="clubs"></a>High School Clubs </h3>
<p>High school students are encouraged to participate in athletics, clubs or other extracurricular activities. Each high school offers many clubs to meet a wide variety of interests. Any student who wants to start a new club should speak to a staff member or guidance counselor. Every club must have a staff sponsor/advisor. Some high school clubs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha Achievers </li>         
  <li>Animation Club</li>
  <li>Best Buddies</li>
  <li>BSAP African American Awareness Club</li>

  <li>SHOP (Students Helping Other People)</li>
  <li>Step Team</li>
  <li>Student Government Association </li>
  <li>Tech Crew</li>
</ul> 

<h3><a name="honor"></a>Honor Roll</h3>
<p>A student's weighted marking period GPA (grade point average) is used to determine honor roll attainment. Weighted GPAs are rounded to two decimal places. </p>

<ul>
<li>Principal's Honor Roll: Straight A's</li>
<li>Gold Honor Roll: 3.4 GPA or higher</li> 
<li>Silver Honor Roll: 3.0-3.39 GPA</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, to make honor roll, a student may have no more than one C and no grades of D or E.</p>

<h3><a name="natl_honor"></a>National Honor Society</h3> 
<p>The National Honor Society offers membership to high school students who meet eligibility standards in all four areas of scholarship, leadership, service, and character. High school juniors and seniors with a 3.40 weighted cumulative grade point average are given an opportunity to verify their leadership and service experiences, and school staff provide evidence of character displayed in school and extra-curricular situations.  A five-member faculty council evaluates the submitted information and chooses the students to whom membership in NHS is offered.  To continue membership once inducted into NHS, a student must maintain the level of scholarship, leadership, service, and character set by the chapter for admission.</p>

<h3><a name="driving"></a>Student Driving and Parking on School Grounds</h3>  
<p>Permission for students to drive and park vehicles on school system property is a privilege, not a right. In order to be granted this privilege, students must obtain a student parking permit each school year, which requires students and parents/guardians to annually attend a driver safety session and to pay the $15 fee for the parking permit. Students must also comply with all school rules related to driving and parking on school property in order to retain this privilege.</p>
