<p>The Howard County Public School System believes that an effective student-centered science program includes an approach to learning that engages the students physically and mentally in an inquiry-based laboratory program. The major goal of the program is to develop substantive science literacy in all students. The program must provide students with opportunities to expand, change, enhance, and modify the ways in which they view the world. Teachers should provide an environment that promotes students' thinking, honesty, curiosity, and questioning. Students should be empowered to express and share points of view, solve problems, and make decisions based on evidence.</p>
