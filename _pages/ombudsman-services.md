<h2>Suggestions  For Effective Communications</h2>

<p>When addressing your concerns, the following guidelines** may be useful in facilitating discussion and problem resolution:</p>

<h3>Organize Your Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly state the issue or the problem you are experiencing.</li>
  <li>Prepare/obtain supporting documents.</li>
  <li>Make a list of questions or points you would like to make.</li>
  <li>Identify several possible solutions you think would resolve your concern.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stay Calm; Maintain A Civil Tone</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on the facts, not on the person with whom you are discussing the issue.</li>
  <li>Avoid blaming, demands and "shoulds." Say "I believe...," "I feel...," rather than "You should..."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clarify Rather Than Assume</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are not sure about something or what you heard, ask for an explanation or clarification.</li>
  <li>Try to understand the other person's view of the situation and the solutions they might propose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be Flexible</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recognize that problems can be solved in more than one way.</li>
  <li>Be open to alternative solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keep Records</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make notes of meeting dates and times, who you talked to and what was discussed.</li>
  <li>Save copies of letters, forms and other material related to your concern.</li>
</ul>
