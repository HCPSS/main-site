<h2>High School Programs</h2>

<p>Each high school has one <a href="/academics/gifted-and-talented/resource-teachers/#high">G/T resource teacher</a> and designated G/T content area teachers who coordinate the following program services.</p>

<h2>G/T And Advanced Placement (AP) Courses</h2>

<p>Every high school offers G/T and AP courses in English, science, mathematics, social studies, computer science, foreign language, art, and research. Included in the high school course selections are AP courses. Students who score well on an AP examination at the end of the course may be granted AP status or college credit upon entering a college or university. Students enroll in G/T and AP courses based on course prerequisites. A detailed description of specific G/T and AP courses and prerequisites can be found in High School Program of Studies. The Guidance Department at each school can also assist in registration for these courses.</p>
