<h2>Expenditure Highlights</h2>

<p>The fiscal 2015 operating budget totals $758.8 million, an increase of $33.5 million or 4.6 percent over the fiscal 2014 budget. This budget:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Placeholder for employee salary increases (negotiations underway - exact amount unknown at this time)</li>
  <li>Adds teaching positions and materials of instruction to support expected enrollment growth.</li>
  <li>Adds positions and funds to support new initiatives of the strategic plan, including implementation of the Elementary School Model Initiative.</li>
  <li>Provides staff and funds to support the new Thomas Viaduct Middle School, opening in August 2014.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zero-Based Budgeting</h2>

<p>Zero-based budgeting was implemented for the first time in preparing the fiscal 2015 budget. Zero-based budgets evaluate all proposed annual expenditures on the basis of strategic priorities rather than history. The process is more flexible and transparent, fuels operational efficiencies throughout the organization, and enables leaders to identify and choose among alternative ways to allocate limited resources. The resulting savings are redirected to fulfill the priorities of the HCPSS strategic plan, Vision 2018: Fulfilling the Promise of Preparation.</p>

<p>Cost-savings opportunities identified during the FY15 budget cycle yielded $3.4 million in ZBB savings and 40 positions to redirect to new initiatives aligned with Vision 2018. In reviewing key activities and program alignment with Vision 2018, 115.6 position requests were not included in the budget request, reducing the proposed budget by an additional $5.4 million. New initiative requests were prioritized based upon their contribution to outcomes in Vision 2018 and another $1.5 million was reduced in this process. In total, the ZBB process yielded a reduction in the budget request of approximately $10.4 million.</p>

<h2>Major Sources of Change in the Fiscal 2015 Budget</h2>

<h3>Mandatory Increases</h3>
<p>Mandatory increases, representing funding for items that are negotiated or required by legislation, total $10.0 million, primarily representing increased costs for employee health, retirement, and other benefits.</p>

<h3>Costs for New Middle Schools</h3>
<p>The budget includes $2.4 million for new Thomas Viaduct Middle School, scheduled to open in August 2014, with 31.2 new positions and materials of instruction.</p>

<h3>Enrollment Related Costs</h3>
<p>The proposed budget adds $1.167 million for 25.6 new teachers and educational support staff to support the projected increase of 358 students.</p>

<h3>New Initiatives</h3>
<p>The budget request includes $7.1 million to fund new initiatives that support the goals and strategies of Vision 2018. This includes 34 new positions. Key programs include the Model Elementary Schools Initiative, implementation of Measures of Academic Progress (MAP)and PARCC assessments in elementary and middle schools, and funding to finance a new data warehouse to provide comprehensive, real-time student information to enhance instruction.</p>

<h3>Savings to Support Mandatory Increases and New Initiatives</h3>
<p>Offsetting some of the budget increase are savings totaling $4.7 million achieved by prefunding $1.3 million of FY 2015 costs with FY 2014 funds and $4.4 million of ZBB budget savings through cuts and redirection of forty existing to meet enrollment needs and fulfill strategic planning priorities.</p>

<h2>Revenue Highlights</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The County allocation of $512.1 million represents a total increase of $14.6 million or 2.9 percent.</li>
  <li>Estimated State funds are $217.7 million, an increase of 0.6 percent.</li>
  <li>Other sources of funding include Federal funds, various fees, tuition, interest and other miscellaneous revenues which comprise 1.7 percent of the budget.</li>
  <li>The Howard County Public School System receives approximately 69 percent of its operating budget from the Howard County Government and 29 percent from the State of Maryland.</li>
</ul>
