<h2>In Accordance with the Maryland Public Information Act</h2>
<p>Every effort has been made to include the most requested information about the HCPSS on this website. If you are unable to find the information you are seeking, please contact the Public Information Office at 410-313-6682 and weâ€™ll do our best to locate it for you.</p>

<p>Officials of the HCPSS generally make public records available for inspection without requiring that a formal request be made in writing. Most requests can be handled quickly and simply by calling the Public Information Office.</p>

<p>School officials may require that a request be put in writing when they reasonably believe that the Maryland Public Information Act or any other law may prevent the public release of the requested record or that a written request will help in providing the most accurate, thorough response to the request. Any written request should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date of the request.</li>
  <li>The name and address of the individual making the request.</li>
  <li>The signature of the individual making the request.</li>
  <li>A brief, specific description of the record requested.</li>
</ul>

<p>Written requests should be addressed to:</p>
<p>Howard County Public School System
Attn: Public Information Office
10910 Clarksville Pike (Route 108)
Ellicott City, MD 21042 (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=10910+Clarksville+Pike,+Ellicott+City,+MD+21042&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Google Map</a>)</p>
