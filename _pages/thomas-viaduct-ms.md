<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The HCPSS plans to  build Thomas Viaduct Middle School within the planned community of Oxford Square in Hanover to accommodate the increased student population along the Route 1 corridor. The new school will be designed to accommodate 662 students in grades 6-8, plus 40 full-time special education students for a total of 702 students.</p>

<p>The school design will  follow the last middle school prototype (similar to Folly Quarter Middle) with some infrastructure modifications and updates for the middle school programmatic needs. Plans will also address energy efficiency and achieving LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 'Silver' certification in order to make this new facility another 'Green' school in the system.The school's construction department will also work collaboratively with the developer of  Oxford Square  to reflect the atmosphere of the community.</p>

<p>Construction began Summer 2013 on Thomas Viaduct Middle School. The project is on time and budget. A community meeting was not held because there were no surrounding homes.</p>
