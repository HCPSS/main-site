<p>We are committed to the success of our non-tenured certificated staff.

<h3><a href="/employees/teacher-induction/mentoring/">Instructional Mentoring Program</a></h3>

<p>Novice teachers receive support throughout their first year of teaching from central office program or school-based staff. Instructional mentors provide support for planning, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. Their support also includes non-evaluative classroom observations and feedback throughout the year that target the needs of the new teacher. This focus on instruction leads to effective teaching, resulting in improved student learning.</p>

<h3>Continuing Professional Development</h3>

<p>Each semester, workshops/courses targeting non-tenured teachers are offered centrally through the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) program. Session content is determined by research in best practices in teacher induction. Additionally, Division of Instruction staff design and deliver sessions for new teachers throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Workshop Series - Site-Based Focus on the Framework</h3>

<p>This workshop series focuses on topics based on the HCPSS Framework for Teacher Evaluation. The content will be relevant for new employees as well as veteran teachers. The modules are implemented at the school site and facilitated by the Teacher Development Liaison (TDL). Sessions will include information, resources and strategies for classroom application of the domains. Support for the TDLs will be ongoing and provided by the Office of Professional and Organizational Development.</p>

<h3>Workshop Series - Framework for Teacher Evaluation</h3>

<p>This workshop series, aligned with standards for high-quality professional learning, will provide a structure for professional growth in support of each domain within the HCPSS Framework for Teacher Evaluation. Each workshop in the series will focus on a particular domain. Participants will engage in a blend of face-to-face and on-line sessions where they will build knowledge and skills in support of the targeted domain. They will apply learnings between sessions in the school setting and reflect on their practice and application during subsequent sessions.</p>
