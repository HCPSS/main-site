<p>Family and Community Outreach works to accelerate the achievement of underachieving student groups through comprehensive programs of school, family and community partnerships. Assistance is provided to all offices, schools, families, and the community in using the <a href="/f/schools/tips_framework.pdf">Epstein Framework of Six Types of School, Family, and Community Partnerships</a>.</p>

<p>Family and Community Outreach is an integral part of Vision 2018: Fulfilling the Promise of Preparation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/vision/support/#goal3">Goal 3: Families and the community are engaged and supported as partners in education. </a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following services are available to families and community members:</p>

<h2>Parent and Family Support</h2>
<p>The Family and Community Outreach Office provides direct services to parents upon request for consultation on preparing for school conferences, helping students at home and monitoring their progress, navigating the school system and building strong partnerships with schools.</p>

<h2>School-Based Communication Liaisons</h2>
<p>The School-Based Parent Liaisons serve as a resource of support to families in the establishment of effective home school partnerships. The liaisons develop effective communication strategies to provide information to families about school programs, activities and resources. They also provide support and training for parents who want to be involved in school leadership. The parent liaisons are assigned to 10 schools.</p>

<h2>Parent Leadership Opportunities</h2>
<p>Training and support are provided to parents who want to increase their level of involvement in the school through parent committees, parent support groups or School Improvement Teams. Parents may participate in structured activities designed to support individual needs or provide resources for already established groups.</p>

<h2>Parent Empowerment Seminars</h2>
<p>Each year the Office of Family and Community Outreach offers parent information sessions designed for the collaborative input and participation of staff and community members as well as the families and their children.</p>

<h2>Family Involvement Action Teams</h2>
<p>These school-based teams use the Epstein Framework to organize, implement, and evaluate school, family and community partnership activities that support the School Improvement Plan. The action teams are composed of administrators, staff, parents and community members. For more information contact the Family and Community Outreach Specialist at 410-313-6794.</p>

<h2>Community Outreach Programs</h2>
<p>The Family and Community Outreach Office coordinates structured workshops in a variety of settings in the community that are convenient to parents. These sites may include community rooms, neighborhood centers or workplace sites. These services include helping parents to understand and monitor their childâ€™s progress, communicate effectively with schools and learn new strategies to support learning at home. For more information call the program coordinator at 410-313-6794.</p>
