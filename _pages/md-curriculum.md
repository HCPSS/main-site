<p>Following the adoption of the Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards, the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) launched a broad-based, yearlong process to analyze the new Standards and compare the alignment of the existing State Curriculum to the Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards. Using only the &quot;excellent&quot; matches in each grade level, development of the new <a href="http://www.mdk12.org/instruction/commoncore/index.html" target="_blank">Maryland Common Core Curriculum Frameworks</a><a href="http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/MSDE/programs/ccss" target="_blank"> <img src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="11" height="10" alt="new webpage"></a> began. Although the Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards did not include Pre-K, Maryland educators created standards and developed the essential skills and knowledge to serve these students, as well.</p>

<p>The Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards Frameworks in <a href="/f/academics/common-core/parcc_framework_eng.pdf">English/Language Arts <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"></a> and <a href="/f/academics/common-core/parcc_framework_math.pdf">Mathematics <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"></a> define the essential skills and knowledge that students need to know and be able to do in order to achieve the academic goals of the Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards. The <a href="http://www.mdk12.org/instruction/commoncore/index.html" target="_blank">Frameworks</a> are the foundation of Maryland's new Curriculum and will guide the development of curriculum resources.</p>

<p>Hundreds of classroom educators, instructional leaders, administrators and higher education representatives continue to assist State officials in developing the new Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards, which will be implemented in Maryland schools in the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
