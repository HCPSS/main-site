<h2>Program Philosophy</h2>

<p>"Children are born investigators, studying, thinking, and building internal models of the world around them. Science is an extension of this natural curiosity to systematic investigation of the material world and the development of a body of knowledge and practices. Science education is not just a process of acquiring a body of static knowledge. It also includes developing the ability to use tools, ranging from microscopes and rulers to computers and test tubes, and the ability to build and explain models, make predictions, and conduct scientific inquiry. Just as reading, writing, and mathematics involve the performance of complex practices, so does science."</p>

<blockquote>- Committee on Conceptual Framework for New Science Education Standards, 2010</blockquote>

<p>The Howard County Elementary Science Curriculum for PreK through fifth grade is consistent with and in full support of the National Science Education Standards and Maryland State Curriculum. It reflects the intellectual rigor of scientific inquiry as well as the attitudes and social values conducive to preparing a scientific literate populace to meet the 21st Century. Effective student-centered science embodies an approach to learning that engages students physically and mentally in an inquiry-based laboratory program.</p>

<p>By capturing students’ perceptions of the world around them, our program provides opportunities to expand, change, enhance, and modify the ways in which they view the world. Teachers promote and value students’ thinking, honesty, curiosity, and questioning. Students are empowered with personal skills that they use to express and share points-of-view, solve problems, and make decisions based on evidence. On-going investigations engage students in manipulating materials and making observations, seeking answers to their questions, and explaining ideas based on evidence. Throughout an activity, students reflect regularly on what they have done, the problems they have met, and how they have come up with solutions.</p>

<p>The Science Curriculum is separated into National Standards: Skills and Processes of Science, Earth Science, Space Science, Life Science, Physical Science, and Environmental Science. <a href="http://mdk12.org/instruction/curriculum/science/index.html" target="_blank">More info....</a></p>

<h2>Green Schools</h2>

<p>There are currently 34 schools in Howard County are certified "green" by the Maryland Association of Environmental and Outdoor Education (MAEOE). To become certified, a school must document activities accomplished over a 2-year period and then submit their documentation for review.</p>
