<p>As the requirements for competing in a global economy have changed, so have the educational needs of our students. Today, more than ever before, high school graduates must be financially literate in order to be prepared for college, careers and responsible living. The HCPSS is committed to ensuring that all students receive instruction in financial literacy that will prepare them to be responsible citizens.</p>

<p>The Financial Literacy program of instruction in Howard County meets the requirements set forth in the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make informed, financial responsible decisions.</li>
  <li> Relate careers, education and income.</li>
  <li>Plan and manage money.</li>
  <li>Manage credit and debit.</li>
  <li>Create and build wealth.</li>
  <li>Manage risks and preserve wealth.</li>
</ul>

<p>The personal financial literacy education program of study in Howard County provides:</p>
