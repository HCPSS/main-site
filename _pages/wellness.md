<h2>Safe Schools</h2>

<h3><a name="procedures"></a>Emergency Procedures Information</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the school year, parents must complete/update their child's emergency procedure information on Aspen, the school system's online student information system. Parents who do not have Internet access may request a hard copy of the form from their child's school. The purpose of the form is to identify persons to be contacted when parents/guardians are unable to be reached in case of an emergency regarding the student. It is imperative that this form be completed in a timely manner.</p>

<h3><a name="closings"></a>Emergency School Closings</h3>
<p>If it is necessary for the superintendent to close or delay the start of schools due to inclement weather or other emergencies, parents may obtain information from the sources listed above. </p>

<p>If Howard County public schools open one or two hours late, there is no prekindergarten/RECC. If schools are closed, or closed early due to weather conditions, all after-school and evening activities, both school and non-school, scheduled in school facilities are canceled. On weekends and holidays, if the Howard County Snow Emergency Plan is in effect by 7 a.m., activities already in progress may be completed but any activity scheduled to begin after that time is canceled.</p>

<p>During times of emergency or adverse weather conditions, we request that you do not call your child's school or the central office as it is important to keep phone lines free for emergency calls.</p>

<h2>Health</h2>

<h3><a name="immunizations"></a>Immunizations</h3>
<p>All students who are enrolled in Maryland schools are required by Maryland law to be immunized against certain diseases.  The immunization regulations state that â€œa school principal or other person in charge of a school, public or private, may not knowingly admit a student to, or retain a student in, a preschool program or kindergarten through twelfth grade unless the student has furnished evidence of age-appropriate immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, measles (rubeola), mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, varicella, meningitis, and tetanus-diptheria-acellular pertussis acquired through a Tdap vaccine."  Preschool students are required to have age-appropriate immunity to haemophilus influenzae (Hib, type B), pneumonococcal disease (PrevnarTM) and pertussis.  In addition, pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and first grade students must have a completed Blood Lead Testing Certificate.</p>

<p>Each student must have a completed Maryland Immunization Certificate Form on file at the school. Forms are available at the school or the Howard County Health Department.  It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian to have the form completed prior to enrolling the student.  If a student receives additional immunizations after school entry, the parent/guardian should send proof to the school health assistant or nurse so that school records are kept current.  Students who transfer from one school to another are required to show proof of complete immunization at the new school.</p>

<p>If a student does not have a physician, or is uninsured or underinsured, free immunizations may be available through the Howard County Health Department.  Call 410-313-7500 to see if your student qualifies.</p>

<h3><a name="accident"></a>Accident Insurance</h3>
<p>The school system does not carry medical insurance for accidents that occur at school, including non-sport related injuries, such as trips and falls, physical education injuries, and recess/playground injuries. Thus, parents are encouraged to enroll students in the accident insurance program. All students are eligible and will receive written information on coverage and costs during the first week of school. However, coverage may be obtained throughout the school year. Online enrollment is also available at <a href="http://www.kandkinsurance.com/sites/K12Voluntary/Pages/Home.aspx">www.studentinsurance-kk.com</a>.</p>

<p>Parents should also consider enrolling students if they are already insured through an outside company. The student accident insurance can help to pay for denied claims through your private insurance policies, or help to pay for rising insurance copayments and hospital costs. The student insurance plans can start as low as $24 per student, depending on your preferences.</p>

<p>The regular student accident insurance does not provide coverage for football. A separate accident insurance policy for football is available or parents may arrange for appropriate insurance for students participating in interscholastic football. For information, contact the Office of Safety, Environment and Risk Management at 410-313-6824.</p>

<h3><a name="med"></a>Medical Insurance</h3>
<p>The Maryland Children's Health Insurance Program (MCHIP) is available for families, pregnant women, and children in need of medical insurance. Applications are available through the school health assistant or by contacting the Howard County Health Department at 410-313-7500. </p>

<h3><a name="medication"></a>Dispensing of Medication by School Personnel</h3>
<p>All medications should be given to students at home whenever possible. However, if it is necessary for a student to receive medication while in school, the following procedure must be followed for both prescription medications and all over-the-counter medications such as Advil, Tylenol, cold and allergy preparations, and medicated lotions or creams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A complete written physician order must be obtained by the parent/guardian; forms are available in the school health room and from the HCPSS health services webpage.</li>
  <li>The parent/guardian must give written permission to administer the medication to the student.</li>
  <li>The medication must be in a labeled container with the student's name, name of the medication, date of the order, complete directions for administration in school, physician's name, and the expiration date of the medication; prescription medication should be in the pharmacy container. Ask the pharmacy for a second labeled bottle for school.</li>
  <li>The medication must be delivered to the school by the parent/guardian, not by the student.</li>
  <li>A new physician's order form must be submitted each time there is a change of dosage or time of administration and for every new school year.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="weather"></a>Weather Guidelines/Recess </h3>
<p>Exercise outdoors is healthy and is strongly encouraged. It provides a break from the regular school routine, a chance to get some outside air, and an opportunity to run off excess energy. If conditions preclude the full recess time, even a five minute break can revitalize children and prepare them for more sitting and academic learning. Children are expected to wear warm clothing to protect them during cold weather when participating in recess or outside activities. </p>

<p>The decision to go out, or stay in for recess, is the decision of the Administrator at individual schools. However, the following are to be considered in determining if recess is to be held outside: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Temperature and humidity</li>
  <li>Wind chill </li>
  <li>Heat index and air quality</li>
  <li>Age of students </li>
  <li>Length of time outdoors </li>
  <li>Adequacy of the children's clothing </li>
  <li>Condition of the playground </li>
  <li>Falling precipitation (more than a sprinkle or mist) </li>
  <li>Thunder and lightning</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, it is assumed that students will be outside for recess when the temperature combined with the wind chill is not less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit or the heat index reading is less than 95. Children with certain health conditions may need special accommodations during extremely hot or cold weather. Parents of those children are to provide medical documentation and/or be consulted for determining if other arrangements are necessary. During hot weather, teachers should provide students a water break before and after recess. Additionally, any student who shows signs of heat exhaustion or overheating should be allowed a water break during recess.</p>

<h3><a name="phys_ed"></a>Safe and Successful Physical Education</h3>
<p>To ensure student safety and quality motor learning, HCPSS physical education students must adhere to the following safety protocols:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wear tennis shoes or sneakers that remain tied or strapped for proper execution of skills.</li>
  <li>Remove ALL jewelry, dangling clothing, scarves, lanyards, necklaces etc., prior to the beginning of physical education class.*</li>
  <li>Remove sharp objects from pockets and hair.</li>
  <li>Pull long hair out of face, depending on activity.</li>
  <li>Wear physical education uniform as required in Grades 6-12.</li>
  <li>Wear play clothes in grades K-5.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Administrators can make exceptions as needed.</em></p>

<h3><a name="asbestos"></a>Asbestos Management</h3>
<p>The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act requires school systems to inspect their facilities for building materials containing asbestos, develop asbestos management plans, and implement appropriate response actions. The Howard County Public School System's program for fulfilling these responsibilities is outlined in the asbestos management plan for each building. These plans contain information on the initial inspections, response actions, and post-response action activities and are located in each school's administrative office.  </p>

<p>A copy of each plan is also located at the Department of Education and is available for public review during regular business hours. The plans may not be taken from the building. </p>

<p>Schools constructed after October 1988 are not to contain asbestos-containing building material. In older schools, floor tiles often contained asbestos and a few facilities have asbestos-containing thermal insulation on piping located in crawl spaces inaccessible to building occupants. </p>

<p>The majority of asbestos removal is completed in conjunction with school renovation projects. Asbestos removal projects are scheduled when the school facility is closed, such as summer and spring break. </p>

<p>For additional information, contact the Safety, Environment and Risk Management Office at 410-313-6824. </p>

<h3><a name="IPM"></a>Integrated Pest Management</h3>
<p>The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program employed by the Howard County Public School System is a proactive monitoring-based approach to insect, rodent, and weed problems. HCPSS facilities are monitored at least once a month to determine the need for pest control and the proper identification of any pest problem. The grounds are monitored on a regular basis by staff during routine maintenance.  </p>

<p>If it is determined that control of an identified pest is necessary, the first  methods used are alternatives to pesticide applications. The exterior landscape IPM program relies on proactive practices such as proper plant selection, pruning, certified seed use, and proper mowing and irrigation techniques. The urban/facilities program relies on non-chemical methods such as exclusion, trapping and sanitation to manage pest problems and reduce the need for pesticides. After non-chemical means are exhausted, or in the event an infestation requires an emergency treatment for the safety and/or health of students, staff, visitors, or the educational environment, pesticide use may be approved for use as a last resort.  </p>

<p>Whenever pesticides are used, the least-toxic effective pesticide is applied. In addition, applications are made in places and at times that limit the chance for human exposure to any pesticide material. No pesticide application will be made without prior identification of a pest and pest problem, the meeting of some threshold, and the determination that non-chemical means have been exhausted. </p>

<h3>Parent Notification</h3>
<p>The HCPSS will, 24 hours prior to any scheduled pesticide application, notify parents/guardians of ALL students at all grade levels if a pesticide application is deemed necessary in the school that their child attends, as well as staff in any HCPSS facility in which they are assigned. Parents of elementary students will receive a paper notice; middle and high school parents/guardians who sign up to receive school news via HCPSS News emails will receive an email notification through the school's front office. </p>

<p>Maryland state regulations require that the school system allows parents of MIDDLE or HIGH school students to request to be included on a notification list for pesticide applications at their child's school. (PLEASE NOTE: Because the HCPSS sends out notices universally, a request to be included on the middle and high school notification list will not provide additional notification.) </p>

<p>To be placed on the 2013-2014 notification list, or to receive a paper copy instead, parents of MIDDLE or HIGH SCHOOL students must send a request including the parent's name, address, telephone number, the student's name, the school attending, and an email address (optional but preferred) to the address below. The requests, as well as any questions concerning the IPM program should be sent to:</p>

<p>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each pesticide or bait that may be used on HCPSS property are maintained centrally and in an IPM notebook located in the custodial office of each facility. The notebooks are available for review by parents and visitors by requesting access through the front office of each school. Web access to MSDS, pesticide label, and pesticide application data may be available this year. Information on access to the data will be sent out through individual school newsletters.</p>

<h3><a name="abuse"></a>Procedures for Reporting Child Abuse and Neglect </h3>
<p><a href="/board/policies/1000-series/">(Policy 1030)</a></p>

<p>The law requires any Howard County Public School System employee or service provider to immediately report suspected cases of physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect of a student. Child abuse is any physical or mental injury of a child by anyone who has permanent or temporary care, custody or responsibility for a child, which harms the child's health or welfare, or puts the child at substantial risk of being harmed. A written report must be submitted within 48 hours of the initial suspicion.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the principal to make certain that the oral report is made immediately to the proper authorities. The principal permits the Department of Social Services (DSS) Protective Service Workers and the Howard County Police Department to interview the child on school premises in connection with an investigation of a case involving suspected child abuse, sexual abuse, mental injury or neglect, whether the child is the alleged victim or witness, and whether or not the child has been previously interviewed by the police or Social Services. </p>

<p>The principal shall determine, after consultation with the individual from the Howard County Department of Social Services (HCDSS) or the Howard County Department of Police (HCDP), whether a school official should be present during questioning. The HCPSS/HCDSS "Procedures Concerning Abuse Investigations During School Hours" shall be followed. </p>

<p>The principal, in consultation with the HCDSS or the HCDP, decides if parents should be notified of a report or an interview, who will notify them, and when they will be notified. </p>
