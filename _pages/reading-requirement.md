<h2>Elementary Education, Early Childhood, Special Education Birth-Grade 3 And Grades 1-8</h2>

<p>Teachers certified in Elementary Education, Early Childhood, Special Education Birth-Grade 3 and Grades 1-8 are required to have 12 semester hours of credit in reading.  If more than 6 semester hours of credit in reading are needed to meet the Maryland Reading requirement, the educator must submit 6 semester hours in reading within the first validity period and the remaining semester hours during the second validity period. Educators needing 6 semester hours or less will have one renewal period to submit the requirement.</p>

<p>12 semester hours of reading in the following content are required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Materials for Teaching Reading.</li>
  <li>Assessment for Reading.</li>
  <li>Methods or Instruction of Reading.</li>
  <li>Processes and Acquisition for Reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or to satisfy the Maryland Reading requirement take PRAXIS II test number 0201 - Reading Across the Curriculum. (The test satisfies the Maryland Reading requirement but does not replace the 6 semester hours of credit needed for renewal.)</p>

<h2>Secondary Content Area</h2>
<p>Teachers certified in a secondary content area (example: Biology Grades 7-12 including Generic Special Education Grades 6-Adult) and teachers certified Prek-12 (art, ESOL, health, music, physical education, special education, and educational media/library media specialist), are required to have 6 semester hours of credit in reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methods or Strategies of Teaching Reading in the Secondary Content Area, Part I</li>
  <li>Methods or Strategies of Teaching Reading in the Secondary Content Area, Part II</li>
</ul>

<p>Children Literature and Adolescent Literature is accepted for educational media and library media science certification.</p>

<p>Educators certified in the areas of Guidance, School Psychologist, Speech Pathologist, and School Social Worker are not required to complete the Maryland Reading requirement.</p>

<p>Note: Currently there is not a PRAXIS test available to satisfy the Maryland Reading requirement for secondary or Prek-12 educators.</p>
