<p>The HCPSS Professional Development Schools Program (PDSP) supports the HCPSS mission and goals and is in alignment with The Redesign of Teacher Education (also known as The Redesign). The Redesign was endorsed in 1995 by the State Board of Education to align teacher preparation programs with school improvement, thus enhancing teaching and learning for all children.</p>

<p>The Redesign is further explained in a manual entitled, <em><a href="http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/NR/rdonlyres/75608A85-6909-4BE3-A4D8-D08C759D0A5A/2930/ImplementationManualReprint2004.pdf" target="_blank">Professional Development Schools: An Implementation Manual</a></em>, produced by the Maryland Partnership for Teaching and Learning, K-16 (Superintendents and Deans Committee). This manual provides the framework for The Redesign as well as descriptions of personnel, definitions of terminology, and developmental guidelines to be used for assessment.</p>

<p>Professional Development Schools (PDS) are an important component of The Redesign. <em>A PDS is a collaboratively planned and implemented partnership for the academic and clinical preparation of teacher candidates and the continuous professional development of both school system and higher education faculty.</em></p>

<h3>PDSP Mission</h3>

<p>The mission of the PDSP in Howard County is to employ the collaborative resources of PK/RECC-12 and higher education to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Promote the achievement of rigorous standards by all <strong>students.</strong></li>
  <li>Support high quality academic and clinical training for <strong>teacher candidates</strong> by providing intensive internship opportunities.</li>
  <li>Provide a powerful mechanism for the simultaneous renewal and professional development of K-12 and higher education <strong>faculties.</strong></li>
  <li>Serve as centers for the identification and documentation of <strong>best practices</strong> in teaching and learning through inquiry, research and reflection.</li>
  <li>Support efforts to achieve the strategic goals of <strong>the school system&rsquo;s strategic plan</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are Professional Development Schools?</h3>

<img class="pict" src="/f/schools/pds/pdspic2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200">

<p>They are schools that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are selected public schools with which the Institute of Higher Education (IHE) forms partnerships, creating a community of learners.</li>
  <li>Are dedicated to enhancing the personal and professional growth of all members.</li>
  <li>Promote sharing the latest teacher research and instructional strategies to ensure exemplary teaching for student learning between and among interns, staff and IHE faculty.</li>
  <li>Engage a broad base of stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, support staff, central office staff, parents, students, IHE faculty/staff, interns, community members and business partners to representatively govern and support their endeavors.</li>
  <li>Are guided by the <a href="/f/schools/pds/standards_md_pds.pdf">Maryland Standards for Professional Development Schools</a>, which indicate expected performance in the areas of Learning Community, Collaboration, Accountability, Organization, Roles and Resources, and Diversity and Equity.</li>
  <li>Work to support school improvement initiatives in alignment with the HCPSS mission and goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to supporting established PDS partnerships between HCPSS schools and IHEs, the PDSP also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supports the partnership between Howard Community College (HCC) and HCPSS through the placement of HCC education students. <a href="http://www.howardcc.edu/academics/academic_divisions/social_sciences/instructional/educ/index.html" target="_blank">More information...</a></li>
  <li>Places non-PDS students in the related arts and other areas (such as counseling, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Placement Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>PDS intern placements are arranged directly between the PDS partners (HCPSS schools and partnering IHE).</li>
