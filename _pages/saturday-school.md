<p>Saturday School is an alternative to out-of-school suspension. School administrators use this program as part of the hierarchy of consequences available when students violate the Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>Rather than suspend students out of school, administrators may assign a student to Saturday School so that they can use their “own” time to complete academic assignments missed as a result of their involvement in disciplinary infractions.</p>

<p>All middle and high schools offer Saturday School as an alternative to suspension.</p>
