<h2>Report through Howard County Public Schools</h2>

<ul>
  <li>(<a href="/f/parents/form_harassment.pdf">BHI) Reporting Form</a> <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)">.</li>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="/f/parents/form_harassment_spa.pdf">(Spanish)</a> <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"></li>
   </ul> 
</ul>

<p><strong>Completed forms should be submitted to an administrator in person, by mail or electronically by e-mail.</strong> The administrator will investigate within 2 school days of receiving the form and implement corrective actions as outlined on the BHI Incident School Investigation Form and the <a href="/f/board/policies/codeofconduct13-14.pdf">Student Code of Conduct</a> <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)">.</p>

<h2>Report through Stand Up HoCo</h2>
<p>Stand Up HoCo is Howard County's community-based campaign to prevent bullying. This initiative uses Sprigeo, an online and mobile friendly form to report bullying that is managed by Howard County's Office of Children's Services. Incidences that have happened to you or that you have witnessed can be reported anytime and anywhere in Howard County using the Sprigeo reporting system. The intention of this reporting system is to create an ease of access for reporting bullying and to allow citizens to report these incidences that occur throughout the county.</p>

<p>Community partners that support this initiative include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Columbia Association</li>
  <li>Elkridge Youth Organization (EYO)</li>
  <li>Howard County Library System</li>
  <li>Howard County Public School System</li>
  <li>Howard County Recreation and Parks Department</li>
  <li>Howard County Youth Programs (HCYP)</li>
  <li>Resurrection - St. Paul</li>
  <li>St. Augustine School</li>
  <li>St. Johns Parish Day School</li>
  <li>St. Louis School</li>
  <li>Trinity School</li>
</ul>

<p>These community partners have agreed to work with the Office of Children's Services on all aspects of the Stand Up HoCo initiative. Each partner has a designated point of contact person who receives and investigates each incident according to its existing protocols. Note that it may or may not be possible to investigate every incident.</p>

<p>The following is a general overview of how the reporting system works:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Go to <a href="http://hoco.sprigeo.com/default_hoco.asp" target="_blank">http://hoco.sprigeo.com</a>. Or you can access the website through a link on any one of our community partners' websites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>You will be asked to answer a short series of questions such as:</h2>
<h3>What is the name of the location when the incident occurred?</h3>
<p>Select the location from a drop down menu of more than 250 Howard County specific locations such as a library or park.</p>

<h3>Where exactly did the incident occur?</h3>
<p>Select where it happened such as on the bus or on the playing field. You can also choose &quot;in an email&quot; or &quot;on Facebook&quot; or &quot;on Twitter&quot; or &quot;other&quot;.<p>

<h3>When did it happen?</h3>
<p>Select the date and time of the incident.</p>

<h3>Describe what happened.</h3>
<p>Use the free text box to enter in as much detail about the incident as possible.</p>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>Select what group you belong to: youth, teacher, parent/guardian, coach, or other.</p>

<p>If you want someone to contact you about the incident, there is a space where you can leave your name and phone number. You do not need to give your name in order to submit a report.</p>
