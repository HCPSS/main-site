<h2>Normal Peer Conflict</h2>
<p>Peers have equal power or are friends with each other.</p>
<p>Conflict happens occasionally or rarely.</p>
<p>May be accidental.</p>
<p>May not be serious; no threat of harm.</p>
<p>Equal emotional reaction from both peers.</p>
<p>Not seeking power or attention and not trying to gain something.</p>
<p>General remorse - will want to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Effort on both sides to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>Bullying/Harassment</h2>
<p>Imbalance of power between peers; not friends.</p>
<p>Repeated negative actions that happens often.</p>
<p>Purposefully done.</p>
<p>Serious with threat of physical or emotional harm.</p>
<p>Strong emotional reaction from victim and little or no emotional reaction from bully.</p>
<p>Seeking power, control or material things.</p>
<p>No remorse - bully blames victim; no guilt from bully.</p>
<p>No effort to solve the problem.</p>
