<h2>Project Summary</h2> 
<h3>Renovation History</h3>        
         
<p>Patuxent Valley Middle School was originally constructed in 1989 with six (6) modular classrooms added sometime thereafter. No renovations to the 97,445 square foot school have occurred since the building was originally constructed.</p>
 
<h3>Current Project</h3>
<p>The FY 15 capital budget contains funds for the planning and partial construction funding for the renovation of Patuxent Valley Middle School. The project is intended to provide a systemic renovation of the existing mechanical, electrical, plumbing, roofing, and other aging systems in the building.</p>

<p>Planning meetings began at the school on November 14, 2013  and will be complete by the winter break. The recommendations of the Planning Committee will be presented to the Board in the form of the Schematic Design Submission at the January 14,2013 meeting.</p>
