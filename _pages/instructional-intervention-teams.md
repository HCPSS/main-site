<p>Instructional Intervention Teams (IIT) throughout Howard County have a focus on supporting teachers to improve student outcomes. Teams help teachers and staff identify and implement strategies for use in classrooms that assist individuals, groups or classes of students. Implementation of IIT is a high leverage strategy that supports <a href="/vision/support/">school system goals</a> and expectations. All elementary and middle schools utilize IIT to support teachers and students. At the high school level <a href="#sst">Student Support Teams</a> (SST) are the vehicle to address student concerns.</p>

<h2>Members</h2>

<p>The school-based team is made up of administrators, educators, student services and alternative education personnel, and other resource staff who will be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monitoring and reviewing cases.</li>
  <li>Providing Case Management.</li>
  <li>Overseeing Kid Talk (at Kid Talk schools).</li>
  <li>Reviewing student needs with classroom teachers and other personnel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem-solving Process</h2>

<p>Team members follow multiple stages to support teachers in addressing students' needs:</p>

<h3>Entry &amp; Contracting</h3> 
<p>The process is explained to the teacher and they are asked to agree to participate in the non-evaluative process.</p>

<h3>Problem Identification &amp; Analysis</h3>
<p>This stage of problem solving focuses on defining a concern in observable and measurable terms, setting priorities and goals, and exploring the Instructional Match.</p>

<h3>Intervention Design</h3>
<p>Interventions are developed for classroom teachers and other educators to use when working with the student(s).</p>

<h3>Intervention Implementation</h3>
<p>In this stage, the intervention is implemented and data are collected weekly for monitoring progress.</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>After 4-6 weeks (typically 6) of intervention, data are reviewed to compare the student's present performance with baseline. Decisions are made at this stage about how to proceed with a case and are dependent on the student's attainment of the goal(s) set.</li>

<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>When goals are met and/or the teacher is comfortable implementing the intervention independently, the case is typically closed.</li>

<p>If you have <a href="/schools/psychological-services/itt-frequently-asked-questions/">questions about IIT</a> or suspect that your child would benefit from the problem-solving process, please contact your child's teacher or the school psychologist at your child's school. Additional information about IIT can be obtained by contacting Dr. Meryl Heyliger at 410-313-5677 or <a href="mailto:meryl_sirmans-heyliger@hcpss.org">meryl_sirmans-heyliger@hcpss.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Student Support Teams</h2>

<p>Student Support Teams (SST) meets regularly to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that students at the high school level receive additional assistance as needed.</li>
  <li>Monitor progress of specific students who have academic, social-emotional and/or behavioral needs beyond what a classroom teacher might address.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Student Support Teams help students receive interventions that are appropriate to their needs and work to increase retention through graduation.</p>
