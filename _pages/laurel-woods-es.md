<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<h3>Renovation History</h3>
<p>Laurel Woods Elementary School is a single-story masonry structure, Type IIB construction (noncombustible/unprotected) that opened in 1973. The building was expanded with subsequent building additions in 1987 and 2008. The building underwent further renovations in 2004 and the roof was replaced in 2005. Currently there are six (6) portable classrooms located in the front and rear of the school.</p>

<h3>Current Project</h3>
<p>The building is in good condition with no identified structural deficiencies. The building is one story with egress directly onto grade around the building. The student enrollment, as of May, 2013, is 564 students. The population of the school is continuing to grow, making the need for the expanded space necessary in order to keep pace with the programmatic requirements of the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS).</p>

<p>The proposed classroom addition will be two-stories with two stair towers providing direct egress from the building. New security doors will be provided inside the existing entry doors to create a secure vestibule visible from the main office. Entry after normal opening hours will be remotely controlled by office personnel. An emergency vehicle access lane will be extended around the south and east sides of the building to the proposed classroom addition. This will also be used as access during construction.</p>
