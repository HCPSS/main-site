<p><strong>Eye-opening Service Project At Hammond Middle Benefits Ethiopia</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-school-days-1206-20121203,0,7083338.story" target="_blank">Click to view Baltimore Sun Article</a>!</p>

<p>On July 29, 1992 the <a href="http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/MSDE" target="_blank">Maryland State Board of Education <img alt="new webpage" src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a> approved new graduation requirements mandating a service experience for all students in Maryland Public Schools. Beginning with the graduating class of 1997, all Maryland students must complete a student service requirement in order to earn a high school diploma. The new regulations state that "Students shall complete a locally designated program in student service which has been approved by the State Superintendent of Schools."</p>

<p>In response, the HCPSS formed a Student Service Advisory Committee consisting of parents, community agency representatives, students and school system personnel. The committee's recommendation was forwarded to the Board of Education. It was determined that in Howard County, the student service requirement would be met as follows:</p>

<h2>Core Program</h2>

<p>Most students will participate in a core program at the middle school level. A core program is a locally designated service experience coordinated through a class or grade level. Our program requires a minimum level of service learning engagement of at least 75 hours from each student. The experience will include preparation, action and reflections components. The unique structure of the middle school program provides the flexibility necessary to implement this approach. In addition, it is hoped that the middle school experience will lay the groundwork for students to continue service to the community throughout their school years.</p>

<p>Service learning takes place in Grade 6 and is offered through Grade 8 as part of the studentsâ€™ regular classroom learning activities. While in middle school, students will participate in a variety of service-learning projects to fulfill the requirement of at least 25 hours of service-learning projects each year. A high quality curriculum-based service-learning project will be conducted under the direction of designated school personnel who must certify that students have met the requirement.</p>

<p>Service-learning is not the same as:</p>

<h3>Volunteerism:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Volunteers engage in service for a variety of personal reasons. They do not necessarily link their service to academic studies nor do they receive academic credit for their efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Community Service:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People engaging in community service do so for a variety of reasons. This is a broad term that can encompass court ordered, stipend or volunteer service. It also does not necessarily link to academic studies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work Study Internship:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Student interns frequently work at for-profit business to benefit the financial standing of that business. They are not necessarily working to improve their communities through these internship experiences. There can be overlap between work study internships and service-learning. Students are engaged in service-learning if through their internship experiences they work to improve the health or welfare of their community while linking this to their academic studies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lending A Hand - How The Community Can Contribute</h2>

<p>There are several ways in which community members, agencies and organizations can support the student service learning program. Interested persons may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participate by forming partnerships with the school system.</li>
  <li>By asking to be included in a central directory.</li>
  <li>By offering to support ongoing projects as determined by individual schools or classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, when the students at Glenwood MS lost a classmate in a bicycle accident, they responded by developing a comprehensive bicycle safety program that earned them national recognition. As part of the year-long project, students worked with school system personnel and a local sporting goods store to develop a bicycle safety lesson that is now part of the school curriculum. They planned and sponsored a community bike rodeo at which bikes were checked for safety and riders were taught safety tips. The students' most impressive accomplishment came as a result of their successful campaign to promote the use of helmets by bike riders. Through the efforts of this concerned and committed group of students, Howard County became the first jurisdiction in the country to require children to wear bike helmets when riding on major county roads.</p>
