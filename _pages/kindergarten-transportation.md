<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Kindergarten students whose official residence is one mile or more to school will be transported with other elementary students at the beginning and end of the regular school day. All distance measurements are from the school door where students are
picked-up and discharged to the property line of the residence or to the unit entrance for apartments, townhouses or condominiums. The school principal can assist parents in determining eligibility for school bus service.</p>

<p>To accommodate parents utilizing baby-sitter or daycare facility services, school bus service for kindergarten students may be provided if all of the following criteria is met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The official pupil residence meets distance eligibility requirements.</li>
  <li>The baby-sitter or daycare facility is located in the transported area of the school that the child attends.</li>
  <li>The special bus transportation request involving a baby-sitter or daycare facility is permanent, and does not involve different buses in the morning and afternoon.</li>
  <li>The student is not an out-of-district enrollee.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bus Assignment and Scheduling</h2>

<p>Once the school bus routes and schedules are determined, parents will be notified by the school principal as to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bus Number</li>
  <li>Bus Stop Location</li>
  <li>Approximate Pick-up/Drop-off Time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Parents</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Emphasizing safe practices when waiting for the bus and when being discharged from the bus.</li>

  <li>Requesting that the child obey and respect the school bus driver.</li>
  <li>Helping the child remember landmarks for his or her bus stop.</li>

  <li>Checking with their child's school to see if adult supervision is required at that bus stop.</li>
