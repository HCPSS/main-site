<p>Below is a list of Pre-K locations in the HCPSS. Although unlikely to occur, program locations are subject to chage.</p>
<a name="healthinventory"></a>
<p>*Please Note: Once your child is accepted into a Pre-K program, the <a href="/f/schools/prek/healthinventory_msde.pdf">MSDE Health Inventory Form</a> <img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" /> must be completed and submitted to the school where your child will attend.</p>

<h2>What is the Pre-K Program?</h2>

<p>The Pre-K program is a high-quality, half-day prekindergarten program.<strong> Students must be four years old by September 1, 2014 </strong>to be considered for enrollment. The curriculum supports early learning and school readiness and provides experiences that foster children's academic, social, emotional and physical development. </p>

<h2>Is my child eligible for the program?</h2>

<p>Per Maryland regulations, Pre-K is provided to any child who meets first priority criteria, which includes income  eligibility, homelessness, and foster care. When space allows, as determined by county-wide enrollment projections, additional children who meet second priority criteria (i.e. English Language Learners, health concerns, learning difficulties) may be enrolled. </p>
