<h2>Immunization</h2>

<p>Maryland regulations require all students to have complete immunizations. No student may attend school for even one day without an official record of complete immunizations. The immunization record must have the month, day, and year of each required vaccination, must be signed by a health department official, physician, nurse practitioner, day care provider, or school official and must be approved by your child's school.</p>

<p>If your child is in need of additional immunizations for school entry or if your records are lost or destroyed, free immunization and assistance is available from the Howard County Health Department at immunization clinics at area high schools (for clinic appointment please call 410-880-5888). Students whose records are lost may be required to be re-vaccinated. A parent or guardian must accompany all students under age 18. Please take all available immunization records with you to the clinic.</p>

<h2>Hearing And Vision</h2>

<p>Hearing and vision screening is done annually in all HCPSS schools by the Howard County Health Department in Grades K, 1, 8 and PreK if the child enrolled is age 4. Limited re-screening is performed.</p>

<p>Referrals are mailed to parents of those children who did not pass the screening. This referral includes information on the reason for the referral and asks that the form be completed and returned to the school's health room.</p>

<h2>Lead Screening</h2>

<p>Maryland State law requires documentation of Blood Lead Testing for all public pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade students in areas designated as at-risk for lead poisoning. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Blood Lead Testing Certificate form is distributed to all students in the above grades at the beginning of the school year. The form is to be completed and returned to the school's health room.</p>
