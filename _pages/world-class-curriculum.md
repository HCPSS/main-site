<p>The changes to the HCPSS Middle School Program of Studies will provide students with world-class curriculum that responds to a number of emerging influences and identified needs:</p>

<h2>HCPSS Next Generation Curriculum</h2>

<p>The HCPSS curriculum provides the foundation of the system's educational program and is consistent across all HCPSS schools. The next generation of HCPSS curriculum is being designed around the standards in the Common Core, developed with the principles of <a href="http://www.cast.org/udl/index.html" target="_blank">universal design for learning</a> in mind, and created to encourage students and teachers to take advantage of the many ways that technology can be used to empower teaching and learning. Curriculum staff and HCPSS teachers are re-evaluating current instructional units and developing new ones. As units are developed and/or redesigned, HCPSS curriculum writers are increasing options for active student engagement, integrating technology more fully into the units, and increasing the focus on reading, analyzing, and writing about important pieces of literary and informational texts. The goal is to ensure that all students receive robust, engaging instruction that prepares them well for a lifetime of learning.</p>

<h2>Global Competitiveness</h2>

<p>Today's global interdependence requires American school systems to strive for international leadership in the field of education. This is critical for this generation of students, who will need a world-class education to succeed in a global society. The new Middle School Program of Studies aligns with the Common Core State Standards, which provide more instructional time in core academic courses, focuses on disciplinary literacy and increases access to world language instruction.</p>

<h2>College and Career Readiness</h2>

<p>All middle school students must be provided with a rigorous and relevant core academic program that engages them in learning, develops critical literacy skills, and prepares them for high school success, postsecondary enrollment, and 21st-century careers. <em>(Source: The Critical Middle: A Reason for Hope, the Maryland State Department of Education Maryland Middle School Steering Committee; 2008)</em></p>

<h2>Disciplinary Literacy</h2>

<p>A decade of research indicates that there are at least three levels of literacy development. Students require basic literacy skills such as the ability to decode, and they need intermediate literacy skills that include many of the generic reading comprehension skills. Students also require the specialized literacy skills that are taught in each content area class. Disciplinary literacy instruction engages learners with
content in ways that mirror what scholars, scientists, and mathematicians do to inquire and gain understanding in their disciplines. For students to be successful comprehending content-specific text, disciplinary literacy must be a common approach in all secondary classrooms and content area teachers must provide explicit instruction on discipline-specific literacy skills. <em>(Sources: Moje, 2008; Shanahan and Shanahan, 2008)</em></p>

<h2>Importance of World Language Instruction</h2>

<p>Just as disciplinary literacy helps students to view the world from a variety of discipline-specific perspectives, the study of a world language introduces students to ways in which culture and language shape the way they experience life. To prepare students for college and career in the 21st century, it is important that they acquire global skills that include proficiency in languages other than English and an understanding of the cultures that speak those languages. Learning languages also enhances overall intellectual growth and academic achievement with an emphasis on critical thinking, creativity, flexibility, and openness to new situations. The new Middle School Program of Studies provides for World Language instruction daily in Grades 7 and 8.</p>

<h2>Adolescent Health and Wellness</h2>

<p>According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, nearly 1 in 3 children is overweight or obese. The HCPSS recognizes the integral link between student health and academic success. In the new schedule, all students will receive 90 days a year of physical education and, whenever possible, instruction will be spread across the full school year.</p>

<h2>New Assessments</h2>

<img class="pict" alt=" " src="/f/academics/ms_program/ms_pic4.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" />

<p>New state assessments will place a greater emphasis on writing than the current Maryland School Assessments (MSAs). Their alignment to the Common Core State Standards will also require that students be able to read, analyze, and write about texts representative of a variety of disciplines. In designing the new assessments, the <a href="http://www.parcconline.org/" target="_blank">Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC)</a> is creating a means to ensure all students are developing the skills that are necessary for success in future academic and occupational endeavors and determine whether students are on track to graduate college and career ready. The new Middle School Program of Studies ensures that students receive focused instruction that not only prepares them for the new assessments, but also teaches them the specialized literacy skills that they will need to move onto the demands of colleges and careers.</p>
