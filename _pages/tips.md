<p>Remember, there will probably be many very strong nominations, so provide as much documentation as possible to help the selectors understand why your nominee deserves recognition.</p>

<h2>Spice it up.</h2>

<p>Adding photos, color and graphics to the binder cover and/or throughout the application can help the selection committee members get to know your nominee. Feel free to include photos of class events and other illustrations.</p></td>

<h2>Provide plenty of backup.</h2>

<p>Wherever possible, include specific examples, quotes, and anecdotes that illustrate how the nominee excels in each criteria area. These add weight to the nomination.</p>
</td>

<h2>Review the nomination guidelines carefully.</h2>

<p>Make sure your nominee meets the eligibility requirements. Also, nomination requirements may change from year to year. If you have any questions, contact the Public Information Office. </p></td>

<h2>Check out previous winners.</h2>

<p>Examples of recent years' winning nominations are available for you to view at the Public Information Office. Please contact us to set up a convenient appointment.</p>

<h2>FAQ - Agnes Meyer Award</h2>

<h3>For the Agnes Meyer award, can the "description of contributions in each nomination criteria" be addressed within the four statements of support, or should it be a brief, bulleted outline?</h3>

<p>There should be a separate description devoted to each of the nomination criteria. This can be provided in a letter, paragraph(s), bullets or whatever format you wish. Since you're limited to 4 letters of support, beyond the criteria descriptions, the nomination will probably be stronger if those letters are not the only documentation provided.</p>
