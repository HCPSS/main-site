<h2><a name="schoolstaff" id="schoolstaff"></a>School-based Staff</h2>

<h3>School Administrator</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Inform the faculty and staff of availability of home and hospital teaching for homebound and hospitalized students. Students are eligible for this service only when illness is documented to be of at least three (3) weeks duration from the time of the completed application or the student has a history of intermittent absences due to a chronic condition. The application should be processed by the IEP or Problem Solving Team, as appropriate, as soon as the team is made aware of the student's illness.</li>
  <li>Talk with parents about the availability of home and hospital teaching when the student will be absent from school for a projected period of three (3) weeks or more as a result of physical or emotional problems or has a history of intermittent absences due to a chronic condition.</li>
  <li> Assist designated staff in completing and forwarding all forms to the Pupil Personnel Worker for Home and Hospital Teaching once home teaching is deemed appropriate by the school team (H/H Form 4, Form 5, and current report card and Interim Alternative Setting IEP as appropriate).</li>
  <li> Develop a procedure in the school for establishing a link with the Home and Hospital Teaching Program, either through the Administrator's Office or through the Guidance Office.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the student is counted PRESENT for the period of time he or she receives home and hospital teaching.</li>
  <li> Provide assistance when established procedures are insufficient. If further assistance is needed, contact the Pupil Personnel Worker for Home and Hospital Teaching.</li>
  <li>Work with parents to ensure continued access to school sponsored activities as appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Guidance</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Talk with parents about the availability of home and hospital teaching when it is determined that the student will be absent from school for a projected period of three (3) weeks or more as a result of physical or emotional problems or has a history of intermittent absences due to a chronic condition.</li>
  <li> Assist designated staff in completing and forwarding all forms to the Pupil Personnel Worker for the Home and Hospital Teaching Program once home and hospital teaching is deemed appropriate by the school team (H/H Application / Form 4, H/H School Referral / Form 5, and current report card and Interim Alternative Setting IEP as appropriate).</li>

<h2>Home And Hospital Teaching Staff</h2>

<h3>Pupil Personnel Worker</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Pupil Personnel Worker for Home and Hospital Teaching to coordinate the home teaching program for all Howard County students who are receiving instruction either within the county or outside the jurisdiction. Responsibilities include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reviewing Referrals - All referrals are reviewed to determine the type of home teaching program most appropriate for the student. Special needs of the students are considered along with any specific recommendations from the physician, the parent, or school personnel.</li>
  <li> Hiring and providing in-service opportunities for home teachers.</li>
  <li> Assigning Teachers - Teachers are assigned to students on the basis of qualifications and availability.</li>
  <li>Planning Course Offerings - Most core courses in grades K-12 offered through Howard County Public Schools can be taught in a one-to-one teaching setting if the subject is compatible with a home and hospital environment and ample materials are available. Emphasis is placed on providing instruction for English, social studies, science, and math. Electives are reviewed on a case-by case basis.</li>
  <li> Problem solving around eligibility issues, transition plans, partial home teaching, and other special requests.</li>
  <li> Coordinating administration of Howard County assessments when the student cannot return to school for them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Home and Hospital Teacher</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the home teacher to instruct students on an individual basis in a home, hospital or community setting in a variety of subject areas for the period of time a referred student is out of school. Home and Hospital teachers act as the liaison among the students, parents, and the home schools to help students remain current with their regular classes.</p>

<p>Collaboration between classroom teachers and home teachers is essential. Modification of the student's regular curriculum, such as quantity and depth of work, may be required depending upon the nature of the physical disability, emotional impairment, time factors, and/or environmental circumstances.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Planning with school-based personnel - Each home teacher maintains contact with the home school counselor and the student's teachers. The home teacher is to utilize materials and an overall plan of the units, topics, and skills to be covered during the home teaching period. The degree of success is dependent upon the cooperation between the classroom teacher(s) and the Home and Hospital teacher.</li>
  <li>Providing the teaching program - The responsibility for teaching belongs to the home teacher assigned to the student. Curriculum modifications may be necessary to adjust to the disability of the student or to meet the needs of an Interim Alternative Setting IEP.</li>
  <li> Grading - The home teacher submits a grade report to the school at the end of each quarter or upon completion of the assignment. The student should receive a standard Howard County report card from the local school incorporating the grades from the Home and Hospital report card on a time-weighted basis. For students on the chronically ill program who have frequent but intermittent absences, the grades will be determined by the regular classroom teachers (see grading policies 2060 and 2122).</li>
  <li>Informing the home school guidance office and the Home and Hospital Office when the student returns to school.</li>
  <li>Informing the registrar/data clerk of the student's grades as soon as the student is released.</li>
  <li>Immediately submitting the grade report form and returning books and materials to the guidance office, front office, or classroom teacher.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Parents</h2>
<p>The Howard County Public School System sponsors a Home and Hospital Teaching Program for Howard County students who cannot attend school for physical or emotional reasons, certified by a physician or a licensed psychologist. There must be a predicted absence from school (a minimum of three weeks) or the student must have a chronic health problem which causes absences from school in excess of 20 percent of the time to make this program feasible.</p>

<p>Access to this program is through your child's home school. The process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Obtain an Application for Home/Hospital Teaching/Form 4 from your home school principal or designee which you and your physician, psychiatrist, or certified psychologist will complete. (For students with behavioral/emotional concerns, the application will include a Transition Plan.)</li>
  <li>Return the completed form(s) to your child's principal or designee for review. School staff will review and sign the referral, develop an interim IEP, if appropriate, and forward all forms to the Home and Hospital Teaching Office.</li>
  <li>The Pupil Personnel Worker for Home and Hospital Teaching will, upon receipt of these forms, assign a home teacher or several teachers appropriate to the needs of the student.</li>
  <li>The Pupil Personnel Worker or the home teacher(s) will contact you to outline the program and arrange a schedule for home teaching mutually agreeable to you and the teacher(s).</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a student is placed on the home teaching rolls and the assignment begins, you should be sure to sign the teacher(s) reimbursement form EACH TIME he or she visits and should contact this office if and when any problems arise. For the period of time your student is enrolled in the Home and Hospital Teaching Program, he or she will be counted present at the home school.</p>

<p>To further enhance the home and hospital teaching situation, the Home and Hospital Teaching Office asks that you, as the adult responsible for this student:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Provide a quiet place for the instruction to take occur.</li>
  <li> Attempt to ensure that there is no interference with the instructional process (for example, phone calls, visitors, etc.).</li>
  <li> Have a responsible adult (yourself, a relative, or neighbor) in the home to provide supervision during the time the home teaching occurs or assist the home teacher in finding a public building (for example, library, community hall,etc.) where the teaching can occur.</li>
  <li>If a community center is chosen, provide transportation to that location.</li>
  <li> Follow through on recommendations on the Transition Plan, when appropriate.</li>
  <li> Inform the home teacher and the school counselor in advance if any sessions need to be cancelled. Absenteeism is noted, recorded, and averaged into the student's grade if work is not made up.</li>
  <li> Assist the teacher as a liaison with the home school when appropriate.</li>
  <li> Inform the home teacher when the child is prepared to return to school.</li>
  <li> Provide new documentation if the student remains on home instruction beyond 60-calendar days.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the termination of the assignment, the home teacher is responsible for completing a grade report about your child which is sent to the Home and Hospital Teaching Office with a copy to the school. If the home teaching time has been sufficient, grades will be awarded. These are to be averaged proportionately with grades already earned in school.</p>

<p>If you desire a conference or would like to discuss this placement further, please indicate this desire on the Home Teaching Application. At the end of the instructional period, complete the Parent and Student Feedback Form and mail to the Pupil Personnel Worker for Home and Hospital Teaching.</p>
