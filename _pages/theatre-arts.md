<p>Theatre Arts provides the opportunity for students in Grades 9-12 to establish life-long relationships with theatrical expression. Theatre instruction combines the study of theatre history and dramatic literature with the development of interpretive and emotional skills. The curriculum encompasses appreciation and demonstration of technical theatre craft and critical acumen. Theatre is a collaborative activity involving the participation of artists, technicians, and the presence of an audience.</p>

<h2>Dance Program Philosophy</h2>
<p>Dance Education promotes aesthetic sensitivity and provides an opportunity for students to experience intellectual, physical, emotional and social growth. Students observe, respond, create, and perform using the body as an instrument to communicate feelings, thoughts, and ideas. Through exploring dance concepts, students demonstrate critical thinking skills and core values as well as develop personal integrity. Dance education fosters positive student interaction and an appreciation for diverse points of view, while establishing strong human bonds which transcend racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic barriers. The sequentially developed program presents a broad cultural and historical perspective, providing unique opportunities for cross-curricular connections.</p>

<p>Research demonstrates that students who study the arts are likely to excel academically, continue to higher education, and ultimately become highly desirable employees because they have developed the kind of creative thinking and social skills essential, not only in dance ensemble performance, but also in the work place.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of Dance Education in the high school curriculum is to provide a comprehensive program based on technical skills in various disciplines emphasizing choreography, performance, and production. In the Howard County Public School System the Dance Education program consists of three elective courses that fulfill the Maryland State Department of Education requirement of one fine arts credit for high school graduation.</p>

<p>Young people engaged in an education that is rich in performing arts achieve emotional, intellectual, physical, and social balance and the recognition that the power of the arts endures for a lifetime.</p>
