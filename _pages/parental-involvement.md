<p>Working as partners, parents and professionals strive to deliver excellent educational opportunities for all children in the HCPSS. National studies affirm that the interest and involvement of parents in their children's education are the most important predictors of success for a child.</p>

<p>As a parent of a child with a special need, you bring historical, medical, educational, and personal understanding of your child as a whole, unique, and valuable human being. Persons working with your child for a few hours a day or even over the course of a few years cannot know the youngster as you and the family do. That is why the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) stresses the role of parents in designing and monitoring their child's educational journey. This role and responsibility combined with the student's participation in school or training programs constitute the personal side or individual phase of the special education process. Special education ultimately is the means by which families and youngsters endeavor to achieve an independent and productive future.</p>

<p>Recognizing the unique role of parents, the HCPSS has passed a policy on parental involvement. The PTA Council strongly supported this regulation. Our school board recognizes the necessity of informed and consistent parental involvement in all aspects of the process.</p>

<h2>Working Together</h2>

<p>Special Education is defined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and outlines the process of education for those children and youth with a disabling condition that impacts their ability to learn. Educational professionals bring expertise and experience to the process. However, only the parents and the family nurture an individual with a disability throughout the educational process. Each component depends upon the other for success in achieving mutual goals.</p>
