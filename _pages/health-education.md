<p>The Health Education program is one component of Coordinated School Health Programs. Health Education programs provide a setting in which teachers, parents, and community members partner to help students focus on health prevention concepts and to practice life skills in a safe and supportive environment.</p>

<p>The National Health Education Standards form the framework for health education curriculum. The National Standards are used by schools to support programs that allow students to become healthy and enable them to succeed academically.</p>

<p>There is a Howard County Essential Curriculum for Health Education for Kindergarten to grade 9. The curriculum is sequential and based on the developmental level of the students. At the elementary level, the health education curriculum is implemented by the classroom teacher. At the secondary level, the curriculum is implemented in grades six to nine by a health education teacher. At the high school level students are required to take one semester of health education to earn a half-credit towards graduation requirements.</p>

<h2>Program Goals</h2>

<p>The health education curriculum supports the following state goals as outlined by Maryland State Department of Education:</p>

<h3>Health Content Concepts:</h3>
