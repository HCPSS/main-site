<h2>What To Do When You Have A Concern</h2>

<p>The HCPSS has both informal and formal processes for responding to concerns and disagreements. To ensure a timely and equitable resolution of your problem, start addressing your concern with the staff member most closely involved. If the problem is not resolved, you may request a review of your concern at a higher administrative level.</p>

<p>You can request assistance from the Ombudsman at any point in this process.</p>

<h2>Informal Process</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Speak with the school staff member who is most closely and directly involved in the situation.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Contact a member of the school's administrative team. If an assistant principal works on resolving the concern, but a resolution is not found, contact the principal with the concern prior to moving to the formal process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formal Process</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Outline specific concerns by completing Part I of the Parent Concern Form and submit the form to the principal. The principal will arrange a meeting to further discuss the concern. At this time, agreements and next steps will be documented. The principal will complete Part II of the <a href="/f/files/form_parentalconcern.pdf">Parent Concern Form <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)" /></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> If the problem is not resolved at Level 1, request a review by the appropriate Administrative Director in the Division of Instruction. The principal will forward copies of the written description of the concern, principal's response and supporting documents to the responsible administrative director, who will review the matter and forward a writtendecision to the parent and principal.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Contact the Executive Director of School Improvement and Administration in writing if the issue is not yet resolved. The Executive Director will review the documentation and provide a written response within 15 school days.</li>
</ul>
