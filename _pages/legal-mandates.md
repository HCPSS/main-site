<h2>COMAR 13A.03.05</h2>

<p>This State bylaw sets forth the purpose and basic procedures for providing instructional services for homebound students. The Home and Hospital Teaching Office adheres to these established guidelines.</p>

<p>The program includes instructional service to the student who is being maintained at home, in a therapeutic center, or in a hospital for purposes of convalescence or treatment, and is restricted by a physician or psychologist for reasons of physical or emotional health from attending a school-based program. The period of time this program is provided varies with the severity of the medical condition. Instructional services to a student in emotional crisis who is being maintained at home or in a hospital shall be available only on an emergency basis.</p>

<p>Home and Hospital service is subject to review thirty (30) calendar days after the initial determination of eligibility. Continuation of service beyond sixty (60) calendar days requires re-verification of need.</p>

<p>In implementing these regulations, the Howard County Public Schools shall comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as appropriate.</p>
