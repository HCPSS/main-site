<h2 id="sec-01">What is BYOD?</h2>

<p>Bring your own device (BYOD) is a program that allows staff and students to use their personal device for HCPSS sanctioned activities and connect to the Internet for instructional activities if approved by the Superintendent. This pilot will take place at selected high schools during the 2013&#8211;14 School Year in grades 9&#8211;12. </p>

<p>The HCPSS is committed to providing students and staff a next generation learning environment in which every student has access to learning experiences and instruction designed around discovery, connectivity and experience. Furthermore, the HCPSS is committed to immersing our students in the creation of knowledge and empowering our students to collaborate, communicate, and innovate. The HCPSS envisions providing a 1:1 environment for our students in grades 3&#8211;12, either with the use of personal devices or HCPSS owned devices, to enhance learning, personal productivity, collaboration, access to instructional resources and for other educational purposes. </p>

<p>The length of this pilot program will depend on (1) the success of adapting instruction and improving learning in the classroom; (2) the success of students adhering to the guidelines and policies for use of their own technology at school; and (3) the impact of load on the network infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="sec-02">Use of Devices in BYOD Schools</h2>

<h3>What are the benefits of a BYOD Program?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Fosters student ownership of their own learning</li>
	<li>Students and teachers have real time access to information using personal devices</li>
	<li>Smooth transition between home and school</li>
	<li>Increases student access to online instructional materials</li>
	<li>Allows for personalized learning</li>
	<li>Increases access by supplementing school resources and equipment</li>
</ul>

<h3>What software will be needed on my child&#8217;s computer?</h3>

<p>No software needs to be purchased.</p>

<p>The HCPSS uses Google Apps for Education (GAfE) and Microsoft 365 as two systems for communication and collaboration. GAfE is a web-based collaboration tool providing productivity tools including a word processor, spreadsheet program, and a presentation program. </p>

<p>Because purchasing a computing device is a choice, anyone may purchase and use other productivity tools that best suit their needs.</p>

<h3>Will my child need to have a signed Responsible Use Policy on file?</h3>

<p>Yes. Each principal/designee will ensure that signed HCPSS parent permission forms (Responsible Use of Technology Agreement/Internet Use Permission Form) are collected and are on file for each student. Signing the document indicates that the student and parent/guardian have read and understand the expectations of the Howard County Public School System.</p>

<h3>When can my child use their personal device at school?</h3>

<p>Students may use their personal devices in class as instructed by the teacher. It is not expected that a teacher will need students to bring devices everyday, and HCPSS will not mandate that students provide their own technology at school. Individuals may use personal technology devices only when approved by a teacher, administrator, and the Superintendent/Designee.</p>

<h2 id="sec-03">Liability/Security/Theft/Damage and Content Filtering</h2>

<h3>Who is responsible for personal devices?</h3>

<p>Staff and students assume full responsibility for their non-HCPSS owned technology devices. This includes the device's safety, security and maintenance.</p>

<p>HCPSS will not be liable for any costs incurred related to the use of personal technology devices, including usage fees, upgrades, damages, and replacements.</p>

<h3>Do HCPSS policies apply to personal devices?</h3>

<p>Yes. Staff and students will use personal technology devices in accordance with all HCPSS policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in the removal of temporary or permanent use privileges, in addition to any disciplinary action. </p>

<p>Individuals will not use personal technology devices to circumvent, modify, or disable technology security measures implemented by the HCPSS. These measures include but are not limited to:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>Anti-malware software.</li>
	<li>Internet content filter.</li>
	<li>Microsoft Group Policy and Apple Parental Controls.</li>
	<li>Network firewalls.</li>
	<li>Computer and server administrative management software.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Who will support students and staff with personal device troubleshooting?</h3>

<p>Teachers and other staff will not store or hold onto personal devices. HCPSS employees will not be responsible for the technical support of personal technology devices.</p>

<h3>How will personal devices be connected to the Internet?</h3>

<p>When performing HCPSS activities, individuals will use the designated HCPSS wireless network, when applicable.</p>

<p>Students should use the HCPSS WiFi internet connection with their BYOD device while on HCPSS property. Cellular data plans do not use HCPSS' internet connection and therefore do not use HCPSS' internet content filter. </p>

<h3>Will the device be protected with Internet Content Filtering?</h3>

<p>To facilitate instruction and practice internet safety, HCPSS' internet connection is protected by a content filter that blocks certain websites.<br />
In order to comply with Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), HCPSS deploys technology which attempts to block abusive, libelous, obscene, offensive, profane, threatening, sexually explicit, pornographic, illegal, or other inappropriate material.</p>

<h2>What if a devices is stolen, lost or damaged when brought to school?</h2>

<h3>Who should be contacted about this?</h3>

<p>Students are responsible for the security of their devices they bring them to school; teachers and other staff will not store nor hold onto student devices. It is always a good idea to record the device's serial number to have in case of theft. HCPSS is NOT responsible for the theft of a device; nor is the HCPSS responsible for damage done to the device while at school. </p>

<p>If theft occurs, you should contact a school administrator to make him/her aware of the situation.</p>

<h3>Can students use another student's personal device?</h3>

<p>Personally owned devices should only be used by the owner of the device. </p>

<h2 id="sec-04">Types of Personal Technology Devices and Accessories</h2>

<p>Students may use devices that fall into the following categories: (1) laptops, (2) netbooks, (3) tablets, and (4) e-Readers. In some instances, teachers may allow cell phones/smartphones to be used.</p>

<h3>Are there suggested accessories?</h3>

<p>A padded bag or protective sleeve is suggested. A headset or ear buds with a microphone will be useful when accessing a website with audio and/or video. HCPSS will not provide accessories for personal devices.</p>

<h3>Will there be &#8220;charging stations&#8221; so my child&#8217;s electronic device can be recharged?</h3>

<p>We anticipate that not every class will be using an electronic device in a lesson every day. Students are responsible to ensure that a personal device&#8217;s battery charge should be sufficient for use throughout the day. &#8220;Charging stations&#8221; will not be provided.</p>

<h3>Are there any specifications for the type of laptop, netbook, tablet, or e-Reader my child may bring to school?</h3>

<p>Buying a computer is a personal choice. Ultimately, each family will need to choose the device that works best for his/her child. Generally speaking, as long as the device is able to connect to a wireless network and access the Internet, this should suffice.</p>

<h2 id="sec-05">Expectations for Use</h2>

<h3>How can I (staff) or my child be using their device during the school day?</h3>

<p>Students will use their personal devices to complete in-class activities, check grades, collaborate with other students and teachers, complete homework, conduct research, access websites with curriculum-related content, keep track of classroom assignments, and record journal entries and other approved instructional activities. Students should only bring personal devices for a specific use in classes where the teacher/school has permitted them. Unless otherwise noted, devices are not to be used in open areas (hallways, cafeteria, locker rooms, bathrooms, stairwells, etc.)</p>

<h3>Will the personal device be required to use the School wireless network? Can 3G/4G service be accessed instead?</h3>

<p>When performing HCPSS activities, individuals will use a HCPSS open wireless network, when applicable.</p>

<h3>Can a students' BYOD privilege be revoked?</h3>

<p>Yes, if a student is not following the BYOD guidelines for the use of a personally owned device, an administrator can revoke the privilege through the regular discipline process.</p>

<h3>Will students be able to use their devices before or after school? During lunch? In the library media center?</h3>

<p>The administration at each school will determine which, if any, locations other than the classroom setting that personally owned devices can be used during the instructional day. However, if the use of the device causes disruption in the specific setting, the student can be directed to put it away.</p>

<h2 id="sec-06">Additional Considerations</h2>

<h3>Will there be technical assistance provided to access the wireless network?</h3>

<p>Since there are literally hundreds of devices that could be brought to school as part of the BYOD program, there is no technical assistance provided other than providing the name of the wireless connection. Students will be expected to know how to connect their devices.</p>

<h3>What access is available to my child if he/she does not bring their own device?</h3>

<p>Teachers frequently provide collaborative lessons which encourage students to work together, sharing information accessed through personal devices. When individual work is assigned, students may use computers and other devices located in classrooms and/or in the Media Center or by signing out laptops from the laptop carts.</p>

<p>No child&#8217;s learning experience or academic performance will be affected because he or she does not have an Internet-connected device to bring to school. HCPSS is committed to reducing technology inequity so every child can learn equally.</p>

<p>Students (nor staff) are not required to provide a personal device for school use, even if they do own one. Use of personal electronic devices is optional. Keep in mind that learning can be enhanced greatly for the entire class even if only a handful of students have a device!</p>
