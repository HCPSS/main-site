<h2>Transition From Pre-K To Kindergarten</h2>

<h3>Do I need to re-register my child?</h3>
<p>You do not need to re-register your child for kindergarten if he/she is already enrolled as an HCPSS student in <u>any</u> Pre-K or RECC program. (Students attending the fee-based Learning Together Program are not yet enrolled and do need to register for kindergarten.)</p>

<h3>What if my child is transfering schools?</h3>
<p>If your child is transferring to a new school, his/her records including: registration, immunization, health, and report card information, will be sent automatically at the end of this school year. A letter, along with other kindergarten-preparation materials, will be provided to Pre-K parents by the end of February each year explaining the above process.</p>

<h3><a name="openhouse"></a>Are there any information events prior to starting kindergarten?</h3>
<p>All of the elementary schools hold events in the spring or summer for incoming kindergarteners. Please contact your child's school for more information. For a list of elementary school contact information, <a href="/schools/elementary-schools/">click here</a>.</p>
