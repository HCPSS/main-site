<h2 id="details">Emergency And Weather-related School Closing Details</h2>
If it is necessary for the Superintendent to close or delay the start of schools due to inclement weather or other emergencies, parents may get information from the sources listed above.

If HCPSS schools open one or two hours late, there is no prekindergarten/RECC. If schools are closed, or closed early due to weather conditions, all after-school and evening activities, both school and non-school, scheduled in school facilities are canceled. On weekends and holidays, if the Howard County Snow Emergency Plan is in effect by 7 a.m., activities already in progress may be completed but any activity scheduled to begin after that time is canceled.

During times of emergency or adverse weather conditions, we request that you do not call your child’s school or the Central Office as it is important to keep phone lines free for emergency calls.

<h2 id="weather">The Decision Process - Closing Schools For Inclement Weather</h2>
<div></div>
If the possibility of inclement weather exists or is forecast, the Director of Pupil Transportation is up by 3:15 a.m. to review weather temperatures at 17 schools across the county, check local television station weather reports, and review national weather service forecasts via the Internet and AccuWeather Winter Storm Service.

Around 3:45 a.m., the Director of Pupil Transportation and supervisors conduct on-road observations of actual road and weather conditions across the county. State and county roads departments are contacted to determine road status, plans-of-actions, and time frames for treating road surfaces. Transportation staff contacts officials in surrounding school districts for information about current conditions in their counties and predicted road and weather conditions.

At 4:15 a.m., the Director arrives at the HCPSS transportation office and reviews updated information, contacts the Howard County and State Police Departments for their assessment of road conditions to determine if the Snow Emergency Plan is or will be in effect. Transportation officials in other districts are contacted again for updated information. Personnel in the school system’s Grounds Department are contacted about the status of school driveways and parking lots and to discuss their plan of action and time frames.

One last assessment of road and weather conditions is made at 4:30 a.m. and recommendations are discussed. At 4:45 a.m., all of the above information is reviewed and a recommendation is formulated based on the worst actual and/or predicted road/weather conditions within any one of five areas in the county, with consideration given to what county road crews say they can accomplish by 6:00 a.m. The Superintendent/designee is contacted at 4:45 a.m., provided an overview of the above information, and given staff’s recommendation. The decision is made to open on time, open two hours late, or close for the day.

If the decision is to open schools two hours late, all of the above steps are repeated beginning at 5:30 a.m. By 7:30 a.m. the original decision to open two hours late may either be affirmed or changed to close. After 7:30 a.m. it is virtually impossible to change or modify the decision due to the logistics associated with opening a school system for daily operations.

If conditions change, the decision to open schools on time or two-hours late may need to be reconsidered. If schools are scheduled to open on time, the buses begin picking up students by 6:00 a.m. If schools are scheduled to open two hours late, buses begin picking up students at 8:00 a.m. These times will be taken into consideration when reevaluation of start times is necessary.

<em>High School Athletics , School-Sponsored, and Community-Sponsored Evening Activities</em>
<ul>
	<li>If schools are closed for the day, all after-school and evening activities in schools—both school-sponsored and community-sponsored—are cancelled. This includes all Howard County high school athletic games and practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="early">Early Dismissals For Inclement Weather</h2>
If inclement weather conditions develop during the school day, the Director of Transportation follows the procedures used to determine late openings or school closures. Generally, a decision to close schools early is made no later than 10:30 a.m. In deciding whether or not to close schools early, the Superintendent will consult with the Director of Transportation, the Deputy Superintendent, the Director of Operations, the Community Services Specialist, the Coordinator of Athletics, the Director of Public Relations, and other staff members as appropriate.

School Sponsored and Community Sponsored After-School and Evening Activities
<ul>
	<li>If schools are dismissed early for inclement weather, all after-school and evening activities in schools—both school sponsored and community sponsored—are cancelled.</li>
</ul>
High School Athletics
<ul>
	<li>If schools are dismissed early due to inclement weather, all high school athletic practices and games are cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>
Advance preparation and planning can minimize the risks inherent in any emergency situation. The HCPSS has worked closely with the Howard County Police Department, Howard County Fire and Rescue, and the Community Emergency Response Network (CERN) to develop coordinated emergency response procedures. <a href="/about-us/emergency-preparedness/">More info....</a>
