<p>The need for all students to study Mathematics is becoming more evident as society becomes increasingly technology dependent. Communication, connections, reasoning, problem solving, and technology are major strands in all mathematics courses. Courses in mathematics are worthwhile not only for students who plan to continue their education in college, but also for those students who plan to enter the work force immediately upon completion of high school.</p>

<h3>High School Graduation Requirement</h3>

<p>Students who successfully complete high school level mathematics courses prior to high school still need to earn 3 credits in mathematics, preferably in higher-level courses.</p>

<h3>High School Graduation Recommendation</h3>

<p>To ensure college readiness, 4 credits of high school mathematics coursework (including Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II) is a minimum requirement for students seeking admission to <a href="http://www.usmd.edu/institutions/" target="_blank">University System of Maryland institutions</a>.</p>

<p>For a complete listing of high school course offerings, download the <a href="/academics/approved-courses/">HCPSS Catalog of Approved High School Courses</a>.</p>

<p>The graphic below is designed to illustrate High School Course Pathways beginning with Algebra.</p>

<p>Notes for High School Course Pathways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Common Core Algebra 1 Seminar is an elective credit to be taken together with Common Core Algebra I.</li>
  <li>Common Core Geometry Seminar is an elective credit to be taken together with Common Core Geometry.</li>
  <li>A student may enroll in the one-semester, SAT Prep in any sequence after the completion of Common Core Geometry.</li>
  <li>Differential Equations - G/T is an option for advanced mathematics students who are concurrently enrolled in or have completed Calculus C/Multivariate Calculus AP.</li>
  <li>Financial Literacy counts as an elective credit but not as a mathematics credit.</li>
