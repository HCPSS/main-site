<p>This report details the progress made within the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) in the ten months since the July 1, 2013 launch of our strategic plan, <a href="/vision/">Vision 2018: Fulfilling the Promise of Preparation (Vision 2018),</a> The report also provides updates on work aligned to Vision 2018 that was underway during the 2012-13 school year and earlier.</p>

 <span class="filemeta">(Pages 1 - 6 of the Progress Report on the Strategic Plan)</span></p>

<h2>Goal 1: Students</h2>
<p><img class="pdf" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"><a href="progress-report-goal1.pdf">Every student achieves academic excellence in an inspiring, engaging, and supportive environment.</a><br />
 <span class="filemeta">(Pages 7 - 49 of the Progress Report on the Strategic Plan)</span></p>

<p>The HCPSS educational program emphasizes instructional rigor in an environment that nurtures the whole child. The outcomes and strategies in this goal area are designed to ensure rigorous expectations for learning while fulfilling students' social, emotional and physical needs.</p>

<h2>Goal 2: Staff</h2>
<p><img class="pdf" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"><a href="progress-report-goal2.pdf">Every staff member is engaged, supported, and successful.</a><br />
 <span class="filemeta">(Pages 50 - 65 of the Progress Report on the Strategic Plan)</span></p>

<p>Our core mission is to cultivate a vibrant learning community that prepares students to thrive in a dynamic world. This mission can only be realized if the adults in our school system are supported professionally and personally, and prepared for and engaged in their careers. The outcomes and strategies under Goal 2 are designed to help staff members thrive and grow in a collaborative, supportive, and respectful environment with clearly established performance expectations.</p>

<h2>Goal 3: Families and the Community</h2>
<p><img class="pdf" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"><a href="progress-report-goal3.pdf">Families and the community are engaged and supported as partners in education.</a><br />
 <span class="filemeta">(Pages 66 - 81 of the Progress Report on the Strategic Plan)</span></p>

<p>A world-class system cultivates the full participation, support and resources of families and community partners. HCPSS considers the dedication of its families and an involved community as among the system's greatest assets. The focus of Goal 3 is to build upon these strong relationships. Outcomes and strategies are designed to more fully engage parents as partners in their child's education, and to strengthen ties with community organizations.</p>

<h2>Goal 4: Organization</h2>
<p><img class="pdf" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"><a href="progress-report-goal4.pdf">Schools are supported by world-class organizational practices.</a><br />
 <span class="filemeta">(Pages 82 - 108 of Progress Report on the Strategic Plan)</span></p>

<p>A world-class system is fueled by efficient and effective organizational practices, and a culture that supports innovation and progress. The outcomes and strategies under Goal 4 align all system resources, activities, and investments with organizational goals. As these strategies are implemented, the principles of continuous improvement, efficiency, and data-informed decisionmaking will be embedded throughout the HCPSS organizational culture.</p>
