<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<p>The school system considers construction projects carefully as each project  goes through a myriad of stages from concept to completion. Starting with school year 2012-13, parents and community members may  follow each of our major construction projects as they move through the stages  of the process.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/deep-run-es/">Deep Run ES</a></h3>
<p>To address functional deficiencies in the school along with a growing student population, additions will be added to accompany more students and  renovations will upgrade the building's systems.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/laurel-woods-es/">Laurel Woods ES</a></h3>
<p>A growing student population calls for expanded space to keep pace with HCPSS programmatic requirements. Proposed developments include increased classroom space and extended emergency vehicle access lanes.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/longfellow-es/">Longfellow ES</a></h3>
<p>The primary focus is to address the conversion of the open space teaching pods into individual classrooms. In addition, administrative offices  will be relocated and the health suite will be developed to meet current state standards.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/thomas-viaduct-ms/">Thomas Viaduct MS</a></h3>
<p>Construction has begun in order to accommodate the increased student population along Route 1. This new building will also address achieving LEED 'Silver' certification to further the sustainable goals of the county.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/patuxent-valley-ms/">Patuxent Valley MS</a></h3>
<p>The intent of the project is a complete systemic renovation of the existing building. Although this project is not being driven by building capacity, upgrades to the mechanical and electrical systems are the priority for this project.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/running-brook-es/">Running Brook ES</a></h3>
<p>To accommodate a growing student population, construction has started on  increasing building capacity.New additions will include 100 more seats of classroom space in the form of a 2 story, nine classroom addition and a cafetorium expansion.</p>

<h3><a href="/school-planning/construction/wilde-lake-ms/">Wilde Lake MS</a></h3>
<p>Wilde Lake Middle School specifically serves the Town Center of Columbia so it is important that the school prepare to meet the demands of the higher student population as Columbia continues to grow.</p>
