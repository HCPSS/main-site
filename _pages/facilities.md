<p>The Use of School Facilities Office provides for the equitable and prudent use of public school facilities by community groups and agencies. The office serves as a liaison between the HCPSS  and all groups requesting the use of HCPSS facilities. In addition, the Use of School Facilities Office facilitates the leasing, operation and management of discontinued schools and surplus space.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the maximum use of school facilities by community groups in an economic and efficient manner. This supports the school system's goal to create an environment in which students, staff, families and community members participate and contribute.</li>
  <li>Develop procedures to enable major cleaning and repair work to be completed efficiently with minimum disruption of community programs during the summer months. This supports the school system's goal to provide a safe, nurturing and academically stimulating learning environment.</li>
