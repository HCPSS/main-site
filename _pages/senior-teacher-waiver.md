<p>The Superintendent has authorized the &ldquo;senior teacher&rdquo; waiver for renewal requirements. Criteria for &ldquo;senior teacher&rdquo; status is 25 years experience OR 55 years of age or older by the end of a certificate validity period. A certificate holder who qualifies for the &ldquo;senior teacher&rdquo; waiver is no longer required to complete course work to renew a teaching certificate as long as they remain employed with HCPSS.</p>

<p>If a certificate holder retires before the expiration date of the current certificate, the certificate holder must meet all certification renewal requirements as defined in Maryland COMAR and should refer to the Maryland State Department of Education website for renewal procedures.</p>
