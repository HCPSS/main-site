<p>The following only applies to students who are transferring from an out of state school or private school. For transfer students, hours will be prorated for those entering HCPSS for the first time in grade 10. The graduation requirement is linked to the grade level of first enrollment into HCPSS. Students who have been/ remained in a Maryland public school are held to the same standards as Howard County students.</p>

<p>Middle School</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grade 6-8 - a maximum of 75 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>High School</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grade 9 - a maximum of 75 hours.</li>
  <li>Grade 10 - a maximum of 50 hours.</li>
  <li>Grade 11 - (first semester) 40 hours.</li>
  <li>Grade 11 - (second semester) 30 hours.</li>
  <li>Grade 12 - (first semester) 15 hours.</li>
  <li>Grade 12 - (second semester) 10 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Option II - Approved Courses</h2>

<p>Students in Grade 10, 11 or 12 may fulfill their student service-learning requirement by successfully completing one of the following courses: Leadership II Community Service, Leadership I/II, Special Education Peer Assistant/ Tutor Course or Student Services Office Assistant/Tutor Course.</p>

<h2>Option III - Structured High School Experience</h2>

<p>Under the direction of high school personnel, students could complete their service learning requirement by performing an independent project encompassing up to 75 hours (dependent upon entrance to HCPSS). This project would involve a school or community-based experience that will be certified by the designated school personnel as fulfilling the graduation requirement. Students completing this option must also complete the <a href="/f/aboutus/form_SSL_individual_project.pdf">Individual Service Learning Project Form <img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a> and submit it to the designated school personnel for approval before beginning their project.</p>

<p>All service learning must be documented using the HCPSS <a href="/f/aboutus/form_SSL_service_validation.pdf">Student Service Validation Form <img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>. It will be the responsibility of designated school personnel to certify that students have met the requirement.</p>
