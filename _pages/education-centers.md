<p>The Cedar Lane School, on the Fulton Campus, provides as structured learning environment for students age 3 through 21, whose needs are so complex that they require a specialized, comprehensive program in a special school setting. The Fulton campus allows for age appropriate peer interactions at all program levels. Instruction is provided for students who are developmentally delayed, and may have multiple disabilities as well as behavior challenges both in school and community settings. The Cedar Lane program offers an enhanced approach for inclusive programming with an emphasis on providing students access to typical peers, schools, and community.</p>
