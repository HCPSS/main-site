<h2><a name="ce_writersguild"></a>Wrtiers Guild</h2>

<p>The G/T Writers Guild is an extension of the seventh grade writing program offered in all county middle schools for selected students who participate in G/T English. It provides talented writers with the opportunity to produce authentic writing based on their individual interests and to have a clear understanding of the elements that constitute compelling writing. Participating students meet at least twice monthly and are expected to submit their writing for publication consideration.</p>

<p>The G/T Education Program publishes a countywide literary and art magazine, Our Voice, annually to provide additional publication opportunities for students. In the spring, a reception in held for those students whose works have been published to recognize their accomplishments.</p>

<h2><a name="ce_history"></a>History Day</h2>

<p>National History Day (NHD) is a highly regarded academic organization for secondary school students. The History Day Extension is offered in most Howard County middle schools.</p>

<p>Each year, more than half a million students, encouraged by thousands of teachers nationwide, participate in the NHD contest. Students choose historical topics related to a theme and conduct extensive primary and secondary research through libraries, archives, museums, oral history interviews, and historic sites. After analyzing and interpreting their sources and drawing conclusions about their topics' significance in history, students present their work in original papers, exhibits, performances and documentaries. These products are entered into competitions in the spring at local, state and national levels where they are evaluated by professional historians and educators.</p>

<h2><a name="ce_shakespeare"></a>Shakespeare Troupe/Festival</h2>

<p>The Shakespeare Troupe provides an opportunity for students to interpret Shakespeareâ€™s works through a collaborative creative production. Students experience Shakespearean drama through a performance-based and language-centered approach as they develop a unique dramatic interpretation. Scripts may be shortened versions of a single Shakespearean play or a compilation of scenes from one or more of his works following a chosen theme. As students compile the script and develop their own dramatic interpretation, they strengthen their critical thinking, leadership, organization, and presentation skills.</p>

<p>Students may perform their production in a variety of authentic venues, including the Howard County Shakespeare Festival.</p>
