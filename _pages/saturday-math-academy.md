<p>The BSAP Saturday Math Academy (BSAP-SMA) has been in existence since 1992. The concept began from a need voiced by parents who wanted their children to receive an "extra push" in mathematics. Parents felt their children needed a more intimate setting to have their skills identified by certified teachers. Parents also requested opportunities to meet other parents and learn strategies to help their children with mathematics at home.</p>

<p>The BSAP-SMA is designed to accelerate academic achievement in mathematics in a unique setting regardless of a student's academic level. Parents and SMA students identify achievement goals upon registration. Teachers review the goals and schedule time to provide as much individualized instruction as possible.</p>
