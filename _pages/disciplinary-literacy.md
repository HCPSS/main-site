<p>"Disciplinary literacy is not a skill set to be addressed once students have grasped curricular content; it is a vehicle for helping them do so."</p>

<blockquote>
-- The Critical Middle, Maryland Middle School Task Force Report, June 2008

<h2>Reading in Middle School</h2>

<p>The last decade of research on literacy development suggests that educators must focus on disciplinary literacy as part of their content instruction if all students are to be college and career ready. Reading instruction in Howard County middle schools supports disciplinary literacy and the writing expectations found in the <a href="/academics/maryland-college-career/">Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards Initiative,</a> while providing students with the skills that will enable them to thrive in a more competitive global economy.</p>

<p>Sixth grade students who generally perform on grade level take two quarters of the Innovation and Inquiry Reading Modules that address reading through an inquiry approach. <em>Connections</em>, a reading transition course using Junior Great Books products, is mandatory. Students must take one other module and may take more if they desire.</p>

<p>These 9-week course offerings will be determined by each middle school principal, and may include <em>The Future of Water; Taking Action to Change My World; Reading as a Scientist: Inventions; or Expanding and Exploring Career Options.</em></p>

<p>Students requiring explicit reading instruction to support basic and intermediate literacy skills will be placed in a reading course with appropriate academic interventions, either Seminar-D (Decoding), <em>Seminar-C</em> (Comprehension), or a class with direct instruction by a reading specialist. Students who may benefit from more instructional time in English Language Arts will be enrolled in English Language Arts Seminar that is <a name="disciplinary"></a>supplemental to the English Language Arts class.</p>

<h2>Disciplinary Literacy</h2>

<p>A decade of research indicates that there are at least three levels of literacy development. Students require basic literacy skills such as the ability to decode, and they need intermediate literacy skills that include many of the generic reading comprehension skills. Students also require the specialized literacy skills that are taught in each content area class.</p>

<p>Disciplinary literacy instruction engages learners with content in ways that mirror what scholars, scientists, and mathematicians do to inquire and gain understanding in their disciplines. For students to have success comprehending content-specific text, all teachers provide explicit instruction on discipline-specific reading and writing skills in all courses.</p>
