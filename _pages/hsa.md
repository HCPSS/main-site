<p>The Maryland High School Assessments (HSAs) are a series of end-of-course exams that test student knowledge of Core Learning Goals (CLGs) established by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). Beginning in school year 2011, students are tested in three content ares:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Algebra/Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Biology</li>
  <li>English 10</li>
</ul>

<p>Students are required to take and pass the HSAs in order to earn a Maryland High School Diploma. There are a number of options to meet the testing requirement for graduation which include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Passing all three HSA tests.</li>
  <li>Earning a combined-score of 1208 on the three HSA tests. (The combined-score option allows students to offset a lower score on one HSA test with a higher score on another HSA test.)</li>
  <li>A student who earns a score of 3, 4 or 5 on an Advanced Placement (AP) test does not have to take the HSA in the related subject. The student will receive the passing score for the content area.</li>
  <li>The Algebra and English HSAs also meet requirements for <em>No Child Left Behind</em> (NCLB) and are used in the calculation of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for high schools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Government HSA - FAQs</h2>

<h3>Why has the Government High School Assessment (HSA) been reinstated?</h3>

<p>During the 2012 General Assembly session, legislation was introduced to reinstate the Government HSA to support the teaching and engagement of students in the area of government and civics. Both the House and the Senate unanimously passed their respective bills and on May 22, 2012, Governor Martin O'Malley signed Senate Bill 293 and House Bill 1227 into Maryland law (Chapters 476 and 477) resulting in the reinstatement of the Government HSA. The Governor placed funds in the FY13 budget for the Government HSA.</p>
