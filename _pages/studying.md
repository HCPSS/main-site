<h2>Why Study A World Language?</h2>

<h3>Everyone speaks English, so why would I want to learn another language?</h3>

<p>Not everyone speaks English. According to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html" target="_blank">CIA World Factbook</a>, only 4.83% of the world population speaks English as a first language. That number doubles when you add people who speak English as a second or third language. This means that 9 out of 10 individuals in the world speak a language other than English.</p>

<p>And that's not the only reason there is to become multilingual. Language learning opens up new opportunities and gives you perspectives you might otherwise not have encountered. Personal, professional, social, and economic considerations all point to the advantages of learning new languages. And of course, the earlier we start to learn a language, the better.</p>

<h2>Benefits Of Language Learning</h2>

<p>Learning another language at an early age:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Has a positive effect on intellectual growth and academic achievement.</li>
  <li>Enriches and enhances a child's mental development.</li>
  <li>Leaves students with more mental flexibility, critical thinking and creativity.</li>
  <li>Improves a child's understanding of his/her native language.</li>
  <li>Creates a greater sensitivity to language and a better ear for listening.</li>
  <li>Gives a child the ability to communicate with people he/she would otherwise not have the chance to know.</li>
  <li>Opens the door to other cultures and helps a child understand and appreciate people from other countries.</li>
  <li>Gives a student a head start in language requirements for college.</li>
  <li>Increases job opportunities in many careers where knowing another language is a real asset.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Is A World Language Class Like?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Instruction is not translation or rote memorization.</li>
  <li>Classes include interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational communication in real-world contexts.</li>
  <li>Classes are 90-100% language-rich learning environments.</li>
  <li>Students are engaged in the learning process by using gestures, visuals, color-coding, organizers, manipulatives, music, art, movement, role-playing, games, stories, and technology.</li>
  <li>Proficiency-based classes motivate students to work with what they know.</li>
  <li>Tests, quizzes, homework, and projects are used to measure a student's increase in proficiency and overall gains.</li>
  <li>Additional practice outside of class is provided in a variety of options including flashcards, labeling pictures, games, making recordings, completing charts, drawing and narrating. Students are encouraged to practice 15 minutes a day.</li>
  <li>Content is based on Advanced Placement (AP) themes such as: personal and public identities, contemporary life, beauty and aesthetics, family and relationships, science and technology, and global challenges.</li>
