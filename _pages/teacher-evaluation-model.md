<p>Our primary mission as a school system is to prepare every child for success after graduation. To fulfill this mission, effective teachers must be at the helm of every classroom, fostering each child's academic growth throughout the school year. A new HCPSS teacher evaluation model will be implemented during the 2013-14 school year that will help ensure that all students have access to an equally high quality of instruction.</p>

<p>The Howard County evaluation model is customized to satisfy the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) requirements. It was developed by a team of 120 educators, school administrators, central office leaders, and union representatives, and was piloted by teachers and administrators at the following 10 schools during the 2012-13 school year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elementary: Dayton Oaks, Jeffers Hill, Ilchester and Waterloo</li>
  <li>Middle: Dunloggin, Lime Kiln and Mayfield Woods</li>
  <li>High: Hammond, Mt. Hebron and River Hill</li>
</ul>

<p>The new evaluation is designed to be a career development tool that provides meaningful feedback to help teachers grow as professionals. Its goals are to ensure that all teachers are effective and to help high-performing teachers excel even further. The evaluation is evidence-based and uses a common set of observation standards to provide fairness and equity for teachers.</p>

<p>The evaluation model assesses teacher effectiveness through a comprehensive range of indicators that balance the teacher's skill in professional practice with measures of student academic progress. Depending on the subject area, grade level and other factors, academic progress may be indicated by achievement and/or improvement on state-mandated assessments (MSA, HSA, etc.), attendance rates and other objective factors.</p>

<p>A comprehensive multi-year professional learning program was launched during 2013 to acclimate teachers and principals to the new evaluation and the expectations for professional practice and student growth. Once fully implemented, HCPSS expects the new evaluation will build confidence in, and among, our teaching professionals, and arm them with the tools they need to help every student thrive.</p>

<p>Full details of all procedures and components included in the teacher evaluation process are provided in the <a href="/f/aboutus/teacher_eval/teach_eval_guide.pdf">Framework for Teacher Evaluation: The Teacher Evaluation Process Guide </a><img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" />.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The new teacher evaluation is one element of a massive wave of change that is designed to reverse longstanding shortcomings in American K-12 education. A quartet of reforms is underway that represent a significant shift in expectations for teaching and learning. These reforms consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New reading and math curricula aligned to the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/" target="_blank">Common Core State Standards <img alt="new webpage" src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>.</li>
  <li>A new generation of <a href="http://www.parcconline.org/" target="_blank">standardized student assessments (PARCC) <img alt="new webpage" src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>.</li>
  <li>New accountability models for evaluating the effectiveness of schools and school systems. (View <a href="http://www.msde.state.md.us/mdclassroom/Vol18_No3_122012.pdf" target="_blank">School Progress Index <img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>)</li>
  <li>Teacher and principal evaluations based in part on measures of student growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these reforms have tremendous potential to raise the level of rigor for all students and to bring K-12 education in sync with the knowledge and skills that students actually need to succeed after they graduate from high school. Once fully implemented, these reforms show real promise for enhancing the quality of public education.</p>

<p>The reforms are funded in large part in Maryland by a federal <a href="http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/MSDE/programs/race_to_the_top" target="_blank">Race to the Top grant </a><img alt="new webpage" src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" />. In applying for the grant in 2010, Maryland committed to implementing the reforms over a four-year period to be completed in 2014.</p>
