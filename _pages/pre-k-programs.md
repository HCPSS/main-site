<p>The Pre-K program is a high-quality, half-day prekindergarten program. <strong>Students must be four years old by September 1, 2014</strong> to be considered for enrollment. The curriculum supports early learning and school readiness and provides experiences that foster children's academic, social, emotional and physical development.</p>

<h2><a name="enroll"></a>Eligibility And Order Of Acceptance Into Program</h2>

<p>Per Maryland regulations, Pre-K is provided to any child who meets first priority criteria, which includes income eligibility, homelessness, and foster care. When space allows, as determined by countywide enrollment projections, additional children who meet second priority criteria (i.e. English Language Learners, health concerns, learning difficulties) may be enrolled.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First priority</strong> is given to all income-eligible students. They are automatically accepted into the program that is available in their school or regional attendance area.</li>
  <li><strong>Second priority</strong> (if space is still available in the program as determined by countywide enrollment) is given to students with other needs who may demonstrate a lack of school readiness.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: Space in the program is limited since the program is often full of first--priority students.)</p>
