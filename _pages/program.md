<p>HCPSS is a participant in the National School Lunch Program. The U.S. government created this program in 1946 to protect the health and well-being of the nation's children. The program requires that schools provide meals that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The most recent guidelines, issued in 2010, can be found on <a href="http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DGAs2010-PolicyDocument.htm">DietaryGuidelines.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Our school meals are economical, nutritious and made with high-quality ingredients. They are prepared in safe/sanitary conditions and are available to all students and staff for a minimal cost. If student or staff members eat lunch at school every day during the school year, they will have eaten 16% of their meals in our cafeterias. (See below meal pattern information.)</p>

</ul>

<p>Menus must meet requirements under the Traditional Food Based Menu Plan developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).Students must take at least <a href="/food-services/offered/">three (3) of the five (5) components offered</a> in our cafeterias for the meal to meet USDA standards. Oversight and analysis of all menu items are performed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HCPSS Food and Nutrition Service Department</li>
  <li>MSDE, Community Nutrition Programs Division</li>
  <li> USDA, Food and Nutrition Service</li>
  <li>Successful <a href="/food-services/staff/">state and federal audits</a> are performed on a regularly scheduled basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Students Are Offered (<a href="/food-services/offered/">Offer vs. Serve</a>)</h2>

<p><em>A La Carte</em>A la carte items are available after  elementary school students have eaten their lunch and at varying times in the middle and high schools. All a la carte items offered in the school meals program must meet certain criteria (see criteria listed below)  set by the Institute of Medicine and the <a href="http://www.letsmove.gov/join-healthierus-schools-challenge" target="_blank">HealthierUS Schools Challenge <img src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="11" height="10" alt="new webpage"></a> committees. No soft drinks or candy are  offered by the Food and Nutrition Service Department and these items are never sold in the school during the school day per the <a href="/f/board/policies/9090.pdf">school system's wellness policy <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)"></a>.</p>

<h2>Purchasing And Preparing Our Foods</h2>

<p><em>Purchasing  Good Food At Good Prices</em>We purchase domestic food produced in the U.S. and follow competitive bidding practices. In 1998 we coordinated a purchasing cooperative that included 12 of our surrounding counties. We continue to  participate  in a 10-county purchasing cooperative today that enables us to economically purchase quality food items in bulk.</p>
