<p>Please <a href="/f/aboutus/purchasing/summer-supplies/14-15-Summer-Supplies.pdf">view the 2014-2015 Summer Supplies Order Form.</a> The form should be completed and returned to the Purchasing Office no later than Friday, January 17, 2014.</p>

<p>Allocations, which were mailed to schools for delivery on December 13, are based on projected enrollments as determined by the School Planning office. The allocation per student has been increased to $8.00 this year and the copier paper allocation will remain at 1250 sheets. Dollar allocation provided covers supplies for both studenst and teachers. NOTE: MOI funds are intended for student classroom supplies, not teacher desk supplies.</p>

<p>White copier paper for the 2014/2015 school year will be delivered, as needed, directly to schools by Office Depot. However, to ensure schools have sufficient paper for the start of the school year, elementary and middle schools will receive initial shipments of 40 cases of white 8-1/2 x 11" copier paper and high schools will receive 80 cases of paper in early July. Exceptions to this delivery schedule can be made, if required, for schools undergoing construction or major renovations, or for those with very limited storage space. Please contact the Purchasing Office by May 1 if other arrangements need to be made for partial or later deliveries.  All schools are to contact the Purchasing Office, allowing one week for delivery, when additional paper is required throughout the school year. Color and legal size paper will continue to be delivered by our warehouse staff over the summer months.</p>

<p>Please note, the Fire Marshal will not allow paper to be stored in hallways.  Paper is also not to be stacked taller than seven (7) cartons (or shoulder height) for safety reasons or placed in outdoor storage containers, as humidity will affect paper and may cause problems with copiers and/or printers.</p>

<h2>Two reminders:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>School staff should check on the condition of classroom pencil sharpeners, clocks and flags and order those, if needed, at this time</li>
  <li>Verify the core size of laminating film used by your school  A number of schools have purchased new laminators and core sizes may have changed since film was last purchased.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the Purchasing Office if you have any questions, x6724.</p>
