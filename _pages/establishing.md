<p>Use these steps as a guide to building a successful, rewarding partnership.</p>

<h2>1. Partner Match</h2>
<p>Consider your organization’s goals and partnership interests, and then choose a school or program that would make a good match.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Location.</li>
  <li>Connections between your organization and a school/program (personal, employees, etc.).</li>
  <li>Alignment between type of business and academic disciplines (science, fine arts, finance, culinary, engineering, etc.).</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>2. Plan</h2>
<p>Meet with your partner to brainstorm and draft a written partnership agreement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus the partnership on enhancing student achievement and supporting safe, nurturing schools.</li>
  <li>Identify specific activities and respective responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Make sure the partnership is a good “fit” - built on common values and mutually beneficial goals.</li>
  <li>Identify potential benefits that the partnership could offer both the organization and the school.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Resources</h2>
<p>Allocate sufficient people, budget, and other resources to allow the partnership to succeed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify a "champion" within the organization to coordinate partnership activities and communications.</li>
  <li>Clearly define and document objectives and responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Carve out time to make it happen - for communications, renewed commitment, enthusiasm, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Communication</h2>
<p>Ongoing, two-way communication is the cornerstone of a successful partnership.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add your partner to your organizational newsletter mailing list, and let them know about news and events in your organization.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner about the good things that are happening because of the partnership! Share your excitement and satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Evaluation And Evolution</h2>
<p>A good partnership is a dynamic relationship - adaptable to changing needs and circumstances.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arrange to meet at specific intervals (at least yearly) to review the effectiveness of the partnership and revise as needed.</li>
  <li>Establish criteria for success that are easy to measure.</li>
  <li>Allow for flexibility in revising the partnership to adapt to new or evolving circumstances and needs.</li>
  <li>Be willing to discontinue the partnership if it isn’t fulfilling expectations or meeting objectives.</li>
</ul>
