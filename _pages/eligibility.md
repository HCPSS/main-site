<p>Students enrolled in the Howard County Public Schools who have a physician's, psychiatrist's, or certified school psychologist's verification of a medical or emotional disability or illness which prevents them from attending a school-based program may be eligible for Home Teaching services. Special education students must be referred through the IEP Team. Regular education students must be reviewed through the Student Support Team or the Instructional Intervention Team. There must be an anticipated absence of three or more weeks or frequent intermittent absences totaling 20 percent of the school year due to a chronic illness. Any student who is admitted to a hospital located in Howard County or in another Maryland subdivision is entitled to receive hospital teaching.</p>

<p>Facilities in Howard County are serviced by Howard County Home and Hospital teachers. Teaching in facilities outside the county is provided by teachers selected by the hospital or local education agency in whose jurisdiction the facility is located. Referred students receive six hours per week of instruction except when otherwise indicated in their IEP. Continuation of services is always subject to review and may require re-verification by appropriate medical personnel.</p>

<h2>Medical Documentation</h2>

<h3>Physical Disability</h3>

<p>A licensed physician must describe the specific illness and indicate that the illness prevents the student from attending school. A statement that the student will be absent for an anticipated period of three weeks or more is required. It must include the date of the most recent examination, the anticipated length of school absence, a description of the medical problem, indication of whether or not the illness is contagious, the physician's signature, and the date that the form is completed. This information can be included on the county form or in a letter from the physician.</p>

<h3>Concurrent Enrollment or Chronic Illness (CHIP)</h3>

<p>Students diagnosed as having chronic illnesses (such as asthma, cancer, sickle cell anemia, kidney failure, juvenile diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or cardiac disorders) are eligible for home teaching services without an anticipated three-week absence. The physician's statement needs to indicate that the illness will cause frequent intermittent absences. Home teachers will be provided when there are 20 percent or more absences once school has been in session for one month and will continue to provide service until attendance improves and academic deficits are addressed. The cause of the absences must be related to the chronic illnesses. Unless there is a sudden onset of illness, chronically ill student requesting service for the first time have usually been absent thirty (30) or more day the preceding year. Referrals will be reviewed each semester.</p>

<h3>Emotional Crisis</h3>

<p>Students may receive home teaching on a short-term basis (60 calendar days) when recommended by a licensed psychiatrist or a certified school or licensed psychologist who is currently providing treatment. A transition plan must be included as part of the application. The plan should include a diagnosed emotional condition, medical and therapeutic intervention, and how implementing the treatment plan will result in returning the student to school. These referrals should be reviewed through the Problem Solving Team or IEP team process. Specific documentation on safety issues is required when the student is a danger to self or others. Home teaching may be appropriate for students who require a brief period of hospitalization, stays in a therapeutic treatment center, day treatment center, or are returning from psychiatric hospitalization. A psychiatrist or psychologist may feel a transitional educational service may be necessary before students return to their regular school schedules. The Problem Solving Team or IEP Team will review, update, and determine the student's need for home teaching, in consultation with the treating professional(s).</p>

<h3>Pregnancy</h3>

<p>Howard County students who are pregnant attend their home schools or the Teen Parenting and Child Care Program during the months prior to the birth of their children. Generally, obstetricians are reluctant to recommend home teaching for expectant mothers in good health except for the final weeks before delivery. They are entitled to receive home teaching for six to eight weeks following delivery. Complications of pregnancy are handled on a case-by-case basis. Home teaching may not be extended because of child care limitations or the illness of the baby.</p>

<h3>Special Education</h3>

<p>Students with a diagnosed physical or emotional condition who have an IEP require additional consideration while receiving home and hospital teaching. In addition to the documentation mentioned earlier in this section, the IEP team must meet to review and revise the IEP, as appropriate. The IEP team shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine the instructional services to be provided to the student as long as the medical restrictions apply.</li>
  <li>Develop a plan for returning the student to a school-based program.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is accomplished by developing an Interim Alternative Setting (IAS) IEP. The Interim Alternative Setting IEP should list specific goals to be addressed and modifications to educational and related services from the student's existing IEP that will be provided during the interim alternative placement. The student's progress should be reviewed every 30-school days at an IEP team meeting until he or she returns to school. A 60-school day reverification is required. Home and Hospital Teaching is not to be used as an alternative placement while a student is awaiting a Central Educational Placement Team (CEPT) meeting or placement in a program.</p>

<h3>Students in Facilities outside Howard County</h3>

<p>If a student is placed in a hospital or therapeutic treatment center outside the county, that educational jurisdiction notifies the Pupil Personnel Worker for Home and Hospital Teaching. If the notification is sent to the home school, it is that school's responsibility to notify the Home and Hospital Teaching Office. The home school cannot authorize payment for home teaching at these facilities. Referrals must be made through the Home and Hospital Teaching Office to assure proper student identification, eligibility, billing, and grading. The responsibility for providing the list of courses and instructional materials remains with the student's home school.</p>
