</ul>

<h2><a name="coordinator"></a>Health Services Coordinator</h2>

<h2><a name="specialist"></a>Health Services Specialists</h2>

<h2><a name="cluster"></a>Cluster Nurses</h2>
<p>The cluster school nurse, who is a registered nurse assigned to a cluster of 2-3 schools, trains and supervises the school-based health assistant to provide direct care to students. Cluster school nurses are responsible for conducting nursing assessments of students with special health needs and developing health care plans to safely address the health care needs of the student in the school setting. They assign tasks, delegate responsibilities, train, and supervise the health assistant to carry out nursing activities such as medication administration, gastrostomy feedings, catheterization, and nebulizer treatments. The cluster school nurses are resources to the school community and collaborate with other school staff to promote health and academic success.</p>

<p>Cluster school nurses work in a collaborative relationship with the school-based health assistant to meet the health needs of the students. School nursing is a specialty area of nursing practice requiring training and knowledge in pediatrics, child and adolescent development, and community health. Health Services staff support academic achievement by addressing the health needs of students and removing health-related barriers to education.</p>

<p>Cluster nurses and health assistants participate on various teams such as problem solving special education team, crisis intervention, and school improvement teams. They also assist students, parents and school staff in identifying and securing appropriate resources to address health-related needs.</p>

<p>The Health Service Coordinator and Health Specialists provide consultative services and are responsible for program and staff development. There are a limited number of school-based registered nurses that provide health care to students with complex nursing needs.</p>

<h2><a name="school-based"></a>School-based Nurses</h2>

<h2><a name="float"></a>Float Pool Nurses</h2>
<p>The float nurses substitute for school health assistants during absences, assist in training new school health assistants, and work in coordination with the cluster nurses and Health Specialist/Coordinator to deliver consistent quality care to the students, staff and visitors.</p>

<h2><a name="health-assistants"></a>Health Assistants</h2>
<p>The school health assistants are certified by the Maryland Board of Nursing as nursing assistants and medication technicians. They are trained in CPR and first Aid. They work in a team relationship with the cluster school nurse and manage the day-to-day operations of the health room. They observe and document health concerns for students, and communicate necessary medical information to appropriate school staff, parents/guardians, and the school nurse while maintaining confidentiality. School health assistants administer medication and provide delegated nursing care for students. They also provide first aid and emergency care to students, school staff and visitors. A registered nurse provides consultative services to the County Diagnostic Center.</p>
