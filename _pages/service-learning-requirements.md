<p>To qualify, service-learning projects must include academic preparation, service activities, and structured reflection.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Equip students with the knowledge and skills needed for service. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teaching students about their community.</li>
  <li>Identifying the needs, issues and problems facing their community.</li>
  <li>Providing them with the specific skills needed to perform service activities.</li>
  <li>An exploration of why it's important to perform service and what it means to be an active citizen.</li>
  <li>Teaching curricular objectives, so preparation activities can be tied to classroom lessons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Have a guest speaker teach students about working with elderly residents in nursing homes before visiting the site.</li>
  <li>Have a representative from the United Way or volunteer center speak about local volunteer opportunities in the community.</li>
  <li>Undertake a research assignment about the service issue at hand, such as homelessness, recycling, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>Perform one or more of the following activities:</p>

<h3>Direct Service:</h3> 
<p>Students have face-to-face contact with service recipients.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tutoring.</li>
  <li>Serving meals at a homeless shelter.</li>
  <li>Working with the elderly in a nursing home.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Indirect Service:</h3> 
<p>Students do not have face-to-face contact with recipients.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Food &amp; clothing drives.</li>
  <li>Walk-a-thons or other fundraisers.</li>
  <li>Environmental projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advocacy:</h3> 
<p>Students educate others with the goal of eliminating the cause of a particular problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing letters to legislators or editors.</li>
  <li>Preparing and displaying posters, plays, or other educational materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Think about the service performed and how it impacted the community. Consider what worked well and what could be changed to make the project better. Contemplate these concepts and re-evaluate throughout the service experience; don't wait until after the project is complete.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Respond to guided questions in a journal.</li>
  <li>Have a classroom discussion.</li>
  <li>Prepare a piece of artwork or skit about the service experience.</li>
  <li>Videotape the project and review/discuss afterwards.</li>
</ul>
