<p>The teacher evaluation score is equally divided between measures of professional practice and student progress in academic achievement.</p>

<p>Professional Practice accounts for 50% of the total evaluation score. Professional practice is measured in four "domains," defined by the <a href="/f/aboutus/teacher_eval/danielson_framework.pdf">2013 Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teacher Evaluation</a> <img alt="(PDF)" src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" />. Each domain accounts for 12.5% of the total evaluation score.</p>

<p><strong>Domain 1: Planning and Preparation</p></strong>

<p>Refers to the teacher's knowledge of content, pedagogy and resources; skill in setting instructional goals and designing coherent instruction and student assessments; and level of understanding about his or her students.</p>

<p><strong>Domain 2: Classroom Environment</strong></p>

<p>Measures the teacher's success in creating an environment of respect and rapport, establishing a culture for learning, managing classroom procedures and student behavior, and organizing physical space.</p>

<p><strong>Domain 3: Instruction</strong></p>

<p>Indicates the teacher's effectiveness in communicating with students; using questioning and discussion techniques, engaging students in learning, using assessment in instruction, and demonstrating flexibility and responsiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Domain 4: Professional Responsibilities</p></strong>

<p>Includes maintaining accurate records, communicating with families, participating in a professional community, growing and developing professionally, demonstrating professionalism, and reflecting on teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Student Growth (Domain 5)</strong> accounts for the other 50% of the teacher evaluation. Student growth is measured through Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) that are jointly selected by teachers and their principals. Teachers develop two specific SLOs selected among four areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Literacy - Reading, writing, speaking and listening, differentiation.</li>
  <li>Mathematical Practice - Overarching habits, reasoning and explaining, modeling and using tool, seeing structure and generalizing, differentiating.</li>
  <li>Creative Problem Solving - Understanding challenges, generating ideas, preparing for action, applying technology, and differentiating, in support of the Maryland STEM Standards of Practice.</li>
  <li>Content - Assessments, performance-based tasks; differentiation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation For Grades 4-8 Teachers Of Record For Math and English/Language Arts</h2>
<p>Teachers of courses that are assessed through state-mandated tests measure student growth through progress on both SLOs and test scores. Grade 4-8 math and language arts teachers have one SLO that accounts for 30% of the evaluation; student progress on the MSA accounts for the remaining 20%. High school teachers of HSA-assessed subjects are evaluated on an SLO and student progress on the HSA, with both weighted at 25%.</p>

<h2>Evaluation For Teachers Of HSA-Assessed Areas</h2>

<p>Beginning in the 2014-15 school year, new tests aligned to the Common Core curriculum, currently in development by the <a href="/academics/common_core/parcc.shtml">Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC)</a>, will replace the MSA and HSA as measures of student learning.</p>
