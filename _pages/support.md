<p>While the strategic plan is student-centered, it takes a holistic view encompassing all of the elements that make up our school system: students, staff, families and the community, and the organization. Below are some ways these groups can support the Vision and what the Vision wants to give back to them.</p>

<h2>Goal 1: Every student achieves academic excellence in an inspiring, engaging and supportive environment.</h2>

<p>Research shows that engagement in learning, hope for the future, and a sense of well-being are the most accurate predictors of students' long-term success. <em>How can we develop these attributes among our students? </em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide personal attention, encouragement and consistent support.</li>
  <li>Reward asking the right questions more than having the right answers.</li>
  <li>Encourage innovation, appropriate risk-taking, perseverance, and collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="students"></a>Students: Connect your education to your interests</h3>

<p>Take hold of your academic success and engage in the learning process.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find out what clubs meet at your school and get involved with what interests you.</li>
  <li>Prepare yourself for college. Take the PSAT and get ahead, or try an AP course next semester.</li>
  <li>Take part in <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/inst.hcpss.me/hcasc/" target="_blank">HCASC</a> (Howard County Association of Students) and develop your leadership skills.</li>
  <li><a href="/students/grades-9-12-resources/#discover">Discover a career.</a> Seek out opportunities  with Project Lead the Way, Career Academies, and Internships.</li>
</ul>

<a name="goal2"></a>
<h2>Goal 2: Every staff member is engaged, supported, and successful.</h2>

<p>A world-class educational system fully leverages the talent, energy and creativity of highly engaged staff. Teacher engagement is a prerequisite to student engagement. <em>How can we foster a culture that brings out the best in our employees?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on what is strong, rather than on what is wrong.</li>
  <li>Encourage innovation, appropriate risk-taking, and collaboration.</li>
  <li>Invest in professional learning that helps all employees grow to their full potential.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="staff"></a>Staff: Develop your abilities to better your workplace</h3>

<p>Actively strive to be an engaged, supported, and successful part of the organization.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check up on our <a href="https://staff.hcpss.org/my/" target="_blank">Staff Hub Priority News</a> section and know what's new with HCPSS.</li>
  <li>Ensure a high level of performance by taking a <a href="/employees/professional-development/">professional development</a> course.</li>
  <li>Pursue higher learning opportunities through <a href="/employees/leadership-development">leadership development</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="goal3"></a>Goal 3: Families and the community are engaged and supported as partners in education.</h2>

<p>Parents grade their satisfaction with public schools primarily through their interactions with teachers. <em>How can we help parents nurture their child's engagement in school? </em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Encourage them to ask questions that engage their child, such as &quot;How did your teacher encourage you to ask questions today?&quot; Or, &quot;How does your teacher make you feel important?&quot;</li>
  <li>Ease parents' access to the information they need to make informed decisions.</li>
  <li>Serve as ambassadors for our schools and system to show parents and our community that we welcome their involvement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Families: Take part in your child's learning environment</h3>

<p>Become a partner in education by getting involved with your child's education.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign up on <a href="https://www.hcpssnews.com/user/userdefault.aspx" target="_blank">HCPSS news</a> to receive updates on both the system and your child's school.</li>
  <li>Ask your child's school about Parent Leadership Opportunities.</li>
  <li><a href="/languages/english/documents/#fam_guide">Learn more</a> about what your child will learn in school.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Community: Foster a culture that supports innovation and progress</h3>

<p>Strengthen the bond between community progress and educational progress.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start a <a href="/aboutus/partnerships/">partnership with HCPSS</a> to enhance student's educational experiences while supporting your organization.</li>
  <li>Senior citizens can join Golden Opportunities to volunteer, attend meetings, and gain access to school events.</li>
  <li>Anyone can get involved with <a href="/about-us/budgets/provide-feedback/">yearly budget meetings</a> to give input on the process.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="organization"></a>Goal 4: Schools are supported by world-class organizational practices.</h2>

<p>A world-class system is fueled by efficient organizational practices in a culture that supports innovation and progress. <em>How can we most effectively channel our resources and talent to support our classrooms?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Incorporate the Plan-Do-Study-Act model in a continuous cycle of measurement, re-evaluation, and growth throughout all school and office operations.</li>
  <li>Align all expenditures to the goals in our strategic plan.</li>
  <li>Provide well-designed technology tools that foster collaboration and communication.</li>
</ul>
