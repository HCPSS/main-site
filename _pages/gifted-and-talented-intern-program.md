<p>"The intern becomes a colleague when he/she walks through the door, and as much as I am there to teach them the little secrets of engineering, I am also there to treat them like a fellow employee and give them the resources they need to seek out solutions on their own."</p>

<blockquote>- Matthew Ashmore, Mechanical Engineer, Alliant Techsystems</blockquote>

<p>"As a mentor, I experienced great pride in seeing our intern grow into a confident, active, and contributing member of our multidisciplinary team; assuming total responsibility for several key aspects of our program and conducting a quality improvement study that taught us ways to enhance the services we provide to medically fragile infants and their families. The time and energy we put into our intern was returned to us ten-fold."</p>

<blockquote>- Brenda Hussey-Gardner, Assistant Professor, University of Maryland School of Medicine</blockquote>
