<h2>What is an Instructional Intervention Team (IIT)?</h2>
<p>Instructional Intervention Teams (IIT) help teachers provide better instruction and support to students. The team works with the teacher to look at the students strengths and skills, what the student is being asked to do, and how well they do it. They use this information to develop a plan for intervention. Many of the plans are implemented by your child's teacher in the classroom and some intervention strategies are implemented by others who support instruction (e.g., reading specialists, ESOL teachers, paraeducators, parent volunteers).</p>

<h2>What is the goal of the IIT?</h2>
<p>The goal of the IIT is to make sure that all resources in the school are working together so that all students can work toward achieving at or above grade-level academic success.</p>

<h2>Is the IIT special education?</h2>
<p>No, it is not special education. It's a team that works with teachers to ensure that all students are academically successful. If, over time, your child's teacher feels that more services are needed, such as special education, you will be notified so that you can fully participate in that process.</p>

<h2>Do I have to sign anything?</h2>
<p>No. The plans that are developed for students use instructional and teaching strategies that are commonly used by teachers in schools. Because of this, you do not have to sign anything.</p>

<h2>How will I know how my child is doing?</h2>
<p>Your child's teacher will contact you on a regular basis in order to let you know how your child is doing.</p>

<h2>What can I do to help my child?</h2>
<p>Talk to your child's teacher to learn more about the intervention strategies implemented and how you can help.</p>

<h2>How long will my child be in the IIT?</h2>
<p>All students are different. It may take different amounts of time for different students to reach the goals that teachers and staff have for them. Members of the IIT are committed to taking the time that is needed in order to help each student be successful.</p>

<h2>Who may I contact for more information?</h2>
<p>You may contact your child's <a href="/schools/psychological-services/staff/">school psychologist</a> for additional information.</p>
