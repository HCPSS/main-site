<h2>Elementary and Middle School Guide Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Guide Overview -</strong> The intent of this guide is to assist the user in navigating the updated <strong>Maryland Report Card </strong>website. It directs users to explanations that clarify recent changes in accountability. Double asterisks (**) denote online definitions that were lifted from the website and strategically placed within this document. When followed sequentially, the guide assists users in viewing their school data for <strong>School Progress </strong>and for the <strong>School Progress Index.</strong> The Table of Contents lists the page numbers of topics so users can preview the content available within the website.</p>

<h3>Accountability</h3>

<p>Maryland has a new accountability system that takes into account growth and gap reduction in addition to achievement to give a more accurate picture of a school's performance and progress. In the new system, these core values provide a School Progress Index that results in a Strand classification of 1(highest) to 5 (lowest) that is used to identify schools that need support and deserve recognition.</p>

<h3>School Progress</h3>

<p>Each school is measured at the All Students and each Student Group levels for proficiency in reading/language arts and mathematics. Attendance rate is measured for All Students. Participation Rate is measured for the All Students and for each Student Group.</p>

<p>The Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) are a trajectory toward 2017, the time by which each individual school is expected to reduce its percent of non-proficient students (basic) for each of its student groups and overall by half. The progress of each school toward meeting their own unique targets provides valuable information over time on the effectiveness of instructional strategies, the inherent needs of the students and the extent to which the school is fulfilling those needs.</p>

<h3>Summary of School Progress Index (SPI) Indicators and Measures</h3>

<p>SPI is compensatory so that a low value on one indicator can be balanced by a high value on another indicator. Each of the indicators comprising the Index are differentially weighted based on their importance in assessing overall school progress.</p>

<p>AMOs for each component of the Index are based on a trajectory toward the goal, the time by which each individual school is expected to reduce its percent of students that are non-proficient (basic) by half for Achievement, reduce its students not showing Growth by half, and reduce the gap between the lowest and highest performing student groups by half.</p>

<p>The AMOs for each component of the Index are based on a 50% reduction of students not meeting the indicator. AMOs are individually determined based on the school and indicator.</p>

<h3>Accountability</h3>

Maryland has a new accountability system that takes into account gap reduction and college- and career-readiness in addition to achievement to give a more accurate picture of a school's performance and progress. In the new system, these core values provide a School Progress Index that results in a Strand classification of 1(highest) to 5 (lowest) that is used to identify schools that need support and deserve recognition.

<h3>School Progress</h3>

Each school is measured at the All Students and each Student Group levels for proficiency in reading/language arts and mathematics. Graduation is measured for All Students. Participation Rate is measured for the All Students and for each Student Group.

The Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) are a trajectory toward 2017, the time by which each individual school is expected to reduce its percent of non-proficient students (basic) for each of its student groups and overall by half.
