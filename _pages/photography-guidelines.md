<p>Commencement ceremonies are public events and, as such, may be photographed or videotaped. The school system's Television Services Department will be streaming each graduation ceremony live online and will be available on demand within minutes of each ceremony's end. TV Services also videotapes each of the 12 high school commencements and broadcasts the ceremonies within 24 hours on HCPSS TV, cable channels 42 (Verizon) and 95 (Comcast) in Howard County. Official event photographers contracted by the school system also take photos during the ceremonies.</p>

<p>It is imperative that media and other photographers and videographers do not interfere with the official documenting of commencement events and observe the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inform the HCPSS Public Information Office (410-313-6682) of your interest in shooting photos or video of one or more of the commencement ceremonies.</li>
  <li>Representatives of news outlets should wear their media ID badges in a plain sight. Upon arrival at Merriweather Post Pavilion on the day of the event, check in backstage with Ms. Anne Roy, the school system administrator who oversees commencement.</li>
  <li>Follow Ms. Roy's directions regarding where you will be permitted to stand in order to avoid interfering with the commencement activities.</li>
  <li>No photos or video are to be shot from the stage unless special permission is obtained in advance through the Public Information Office and Ms. Roy. Special permission will not be granted on the day of the commencement.</li>
  <li>Failure to follow these guidelines may result in removal from the premises.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for helping us make HCPSS commencement ceremonies a positive, memorable event for our graduates and their families.</p>
