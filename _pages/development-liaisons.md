<p>Every school in Howard County has an identified teacher leader known as the Teacher Development Liaison (Master Teacher). The role of this master teacher is to provide ongoing, school-based professional learning opportunities and support for all non-tenured staff aligned with best practices for instruction and the <em><a href="http://danielsongroup.org/research/" target="_blank">Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching</a></em> TDLs begin the year by welcoming new teachers into their schools with a building tour and networking lunch during NTO week. They continue throughout the year coordinating school-based support for non-tenured teachers by facilitating non-tenured teacher meetings at the school site and supporting experienced colleagues who work with new hires. </p>

<p>The site-based professional learning includes <em>Focus on the Framework</em> a professional learning series that addresses topics within the <em>Framework for Teacher Evaluation</em> which is grounded in the <em>Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching</em> and targets first-year teachers. Program innovations include differentiated support for 2nd and 3rd year non-tenured teachers via on-line mentoring supports and team-based and self-guided multi-modal professional learning bundles grounded in the <em>Framework for Teacher Evaluation</em>. TDLs receive support and training from staff within the Office of Professional and Organizational Development.</p>
