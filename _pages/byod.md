<h2>Pilot Overview</h2>

<img alt="" src="/f/byod/byod-logo.png">

<p>Bring your own device (BYOD) is a program that allows staff and students to use their personal device for HCPSS sanctioned activities and connect to the Internet for instructional activities. This pilot took place at selected high schools during the 2013&#8211;14 School Year in Grades 9&#8211;12.</p>

<p>In the 2014&#8211;2015 school year, students and staff will be permitted to use personal devices for HCPSS&#8211;approved activities and connect to the Internet for approved instructional activities at all 12 high schools and Thomas Viaduct Middle School.</p>

<h2>What if My Student Can&#8217;t Bring a Device?</h2>

<p>No child&#8217;s learning experience or academic performance will be affected because he or she does not have an Internet-connected device to bring to school. Use of personal electronic devices is optional.</p>

<h2>Student Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Individuals will be permitted to use personal technology devices in accordance with related HCPSS policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in the temporary or permanent revocation of use privileges, in addition to any other disciplinary action that may be taken. </p>

<p>HCPSS is not responsible for lost or damaged devices. </p>
