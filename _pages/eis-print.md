<h2>What Is The Educator Information System (EIS)?</h2>
<p>The Educator Information System (EIS) is Maryland&rsquo;s web-based source for educator certification. EIS provides educators with the tools necessary to complete an initial application for a Maryland certificate. It also provides those who already have Maryland certification with access to their personal information.  In addition, it provides local school systems with the tools to enhance certification-related services for employed educators.</p>

<h2>How Will I Receive My Certificate?</h2>
<p>MSDE will no longer print Maryland certificates. Once your request for certification has been approved, you will be able to view, download, and print your certificate by logging onto <a href="http://www.mdcert.org" target="_blank">www.mdcert.org <img src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="11" height="10" alt="new webpage" /></a>. Providing an electronic &ldquo;digital&rdquo; certificate allows you immediate access, portability, and the ability to print or electronically transmit your certificate whenever you like.</p>

<h2>How Do I Access EIS?</h2>
<p>Individuals can access EIS through the home page of the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) at <a href="http://www.mdcert.org" target="_blank">www.mdcert.org <img src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="11" height="10" alt="new webpage" /></a>.  Individuals will need to establish an access account by entering identifying information and creating a user ID and password.  There are detailed instructions at the site to guide individuals through the process.</p>
