<p>The HCPSS requires all applicants to disclose and document criminal background information through the completion of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The HCPSS online employment application</li>
  <li>The Criminal Background Investigation Form (Family Law Article, 5-560 et.seq)</li>
  <li> The Howard County Department of Social Services Release of Information Form</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to disclose information is grounds for immediate dismissal. The HCPSS will complete background checks for all prospective employees through the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maryland Judiciary Case Search</li>
  <li>National and State Sex Offender Registry</li>
  <li>The Howard County Department of Social Services child abuse and/or neglect background check</li>
  <li>State and FBI Fingerprint criminal background check</li>
</ul>

<p>If during the employment application process any information regarding criminal, child abuse or neglect issues is disclosed, discovered, or found to be inconsistent, the application evaluation process will stop and the information will be investigated.</p>
