<h3>Feasibility Study</h3>
<p>Each year, the Board of Education reviews capital planning options and redistricting scenarios through a feasibility study. The annual student enrollment projection is introduced along with scenarios that are intended to provide a comprehensive look at suggested capital additions, renovations, and any attendance area adjustments that are anticipated within a ten year timeframe.</p>
</li> 

<li class="tl-node"><h3>Attendance Area Committee Meetings</h3>
<p>The Attendance Area Committee (AAC) develops and evaluates potential school redistricting plans to advise the Superintendent.</p>
</li>  

<li class="tl-node"><h3>Board of Education Approval Process</h3>
<p>The Board of Education reviews the recommendations and decides whether it will move to approve the school attendance areas at a Board of Education meeting.</p>
