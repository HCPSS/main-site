<p>Howard County parents, families and community members are active partners in educating children and share a vital role in ensuring their success in school. There may be times when you, as a parent, guardian, custodian or community member will need to address a concern or may disagree with a decision or action taken by Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) personnel. The role of the Ombudsman is to provide information and assist with the resolution of problems you may encounter.</p>

<p>The Ombudsman must follow Board of Education policies and HCPSS procedures, and does not have the authority to change policy or force school personnel to take specific action. The Ombudsman does not decide who is &quot;innocent&quot; or who is &quot;guilty.&quot;  However, the Ombudsman will listen, review your situation, and assist with the timely and equitable resolution of your concerns.</p>

<h2>Ombudsman Services</h2>

<p><a href="/board/ombudsman-services/">Services</a> of the Ombudsman include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Confidential discussion of your concern.*</li>
  <li>Research of applicable school system information, including Board of Education policies and procedures.</li>
  <li>Referrals to appropriate school system and community resources.</li>

<h2>What To Do When You Have A Concern</h2>

<p>The HCPSS has both <a href="/board/resolution-process/">informal and formal processes</a> for responding to concerns and disagreements. To ensure a timely and equitable resolution of your problem, start addressing your concern with the staff member most closely involved. If the problem is not resolved, you may request a review of your concern at a higher administrative level.</p>

<p>You can request assistance from the Ombudsman at any point in this process.</p>

<h3>Informal Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Speak with the school staff member who is most closely and directly involved in the situation.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Formal Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Outline specific concerns by completing Part I of the Parent Concern Form and submit the form to the principal. The principal will arrange a meeting to further discuss the concern. At this time, agreements and next steps will be documented. The principal will complete Part II of the <a href="/f/files/form_parentalconcern.pdf">Parent Concern Form <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)" /></a>.</li>
