<p>Advance preparation and planning can minimize the risks inherent in any emergency situation. The HCPSS has worked closely with the Howard County Police Department, Howard County Fire and Rescue, and the Community Emergency Response Network (CERN) to develop coordinated emergency response procedures.</p>

<p>In times of emergency when a system-level crisis response is required, an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is activated at the Department of Education, located on Route 108 in Ellicott City. The Chief Operating Officer assumes the role of incident commander and coordinates the system response through various central administrators who have been trained to assume specific roles in times of emergency. The school system has conducted multiple tabletop and on-site emergency response drills with personnel from Fire and Rescue and the Police Department in order to review and improve the system's emergency response procedures.</p>

<p><a href="/about-us/emergency-preparedness/frequently-asked-questions/">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>

<h2>Emergency Procedure Form </h2>
<p>All students will receive an Emergency Procedure Form at the beginning of the school year. The purpose of the form is to identify persons to be contacted when parents/guardians are unable to be reached in case of an emergency regarding the student. It is imperative that this form be completed in a timely manner and returned to the school on the appropriate due date. </p>

<h2>Local School Emergency Response Plans</h2>
<p>Each public school in Howard County has developed a School Emergency Response Plan. The plan is updated annually and reviewed with all building staff. It includes school site information, staff responsibilities in time of emergency, the type of training staff will receive and when training will occur, and annual plans for 10 drills.</p>

<p>The plan also defines emergency response operations such as potential command posts locations, communications plans, the teacher &quot;buddy&quot; system, student release procedures, general emergency actions, and hazard-specific procedures.</p>

<p>Attached to the emergency plan are site maps, which identify assembly areas, traffic flow information, request and release gates, outside and inside command posts, loading areas, utilities controls and potential medical station areas. Also included are any prearranged agreements with adjacent businesses or facilities for the provision of emergency shelter.</p>

<h2>Emergency Incident Kits</h2>
<p>Emergency Incident Kits have been provided to each school. The kit, which is portable and can be replenished easily, includes such items as first aid supplies, emergency blankets, barrier caution tape, duct tape, megaphones, orange, high-visibility vests, and an AM/FM radio and batteries. Schools are responsible for adding items to the kit such as school floor plans, a staff roster, student emergency procedures cards, and area maps. Additionally, each school has been issued a weather alert radio.</p>

  <li>Students and staff remain in the evacuation area and await instructions from school command. </li>
</ul>

<p>This action is considered appropriate for, but is not limited to, situations such as floods, fires, hazardous materials incidents, or other situations that may render the school site unsafe. </p>

<h2>Emergency Communications</h2>
<p>If an emergency occurs during school hours: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not drive to the school unless directed to do so. </li>
  <li>Do not call the school. </li>
  <li>Tune to news media for emergency instructions. </li>
</ul>

<p>In times of emergency, information about the status of schools is <a href="/news/emergency-closings/">communicated through a variety of media</a>. The school system requests that parents do not call their child's school or the central office in times of emergency as it is important to keep phone lines free for emergency communications. Circumstances may prevent parents from picking up their children or may require that children be picked up at a location other than the school.</p>

<p>The safety of children and staff is our first priority. Our second priority is the reunification of parents with their children. </p>

<h2>Emergency School Closings </h2>
<p> If it is necessary for the superintendent to <a href="/news/emergency-closings/#weather">close or delay the start of schools due to inclement weather</a> or other emergencies, parents may get information from the sources listed above.</p>

<p> If Howard County public schools open one or two hours late, there is no prekindergarten/RECC. If schools are closed, or closed early due to weather conditions, all after-school and evening activities, both school and non-school, scheduled in school facilities are canceled. On weekends and holidays, if the Howard County Snow Emergency Plan is in effect by 7 a.m., activities already in progress may be completed but any activity scheduled to begin after that time is canceled.</p>

<p> During times of emergency or adverse weather conditions, we request that you do not call your child's school or the central office as it is important to keep phone lines free for emergency calls. </p>
