<p>The Teenage Parenting and Childcare program is a school-based program that enables teen parents to participate in a comprehensive high school course of studies, receive counseling that supports academic and behavioral improvements, and obtain child care.</p>

<p>The program is located at Wilde Lake High School and transportation is provided for participating students and their babies. The program has capacity for approximately 30 students and 15 young children.</p>

<p>Outreach services are also provided for pregnant teens, and for parenting teens who have other options for child care and choose to remain in their home schools after the birth of their child.</p>
