<h2>Overview and Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) PreK-12 social studies program has changed considerably over the past 20 years, and has been influenced by national standards documents in multiple disciplines within the social studies (History, Geography, Civics, Economics, Peoples of the Nation and World, and Social Studies Skills and Processes), by the<a href="http://mdk12.org/instruction/curriculum/social_studies/index.html" target="_blank"> Maryland State Department of Education Social Studies Standards</a>, by <a href="http://www.socialstudies.org/c3" target="_blank">The College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Inquiry in Social Studies,</a> by research findings, and by the changing nature of standardized assessments.</p>

<p>Social Studies skills and content are interwoven throughout the program. Exemplar lessons are designed to actively engage students in the content of social studies by interacting with a variety of resources and then showing what they have learned through various performance-based assessments. This approach has an internal support structure for students with various learning strengths and provides natural opportunities for differentiated instruction and assessments that are guided by the principles of Universal Design for Learning. In addition, lessons have been designed with the purposeful integration of English Language Arts standards in order to allow students to reinforce and practice these skills in an authentic setting.</p>

<p>Beyond the goals and objectives of the curriculum lies the true mission of social studies, to provide those experiences that develop in students the knowledge, concepts, strategies, and skills needed to promote citizenship in a diverse and changing world. Good social studies instruction is meaningful, engaging, and challenging.</p>

<h2>Primary Social Studies Units</h2>
<p>Students in the primary grades begin their exposure to social studies by first observing and examining the world around them. Students determine their responsibilities in their home, school and community. They then learn how to use maps and globes to guide their discovery of the various characteristics of their community, country, and world. This includes learning about human and physical or natural features.</p>

<p>Throughout their study, students learn about important people such as historical figures, innovators, and leaders from the past and present. Students also learn about the factors of production and economic principals that guide the world around them. Furthermore, students build on their geographic knowledge to learn about the various cultures of the people in their school and community.</p>

<h2>Intermediate Social Studies Units </h2>

<p>Third grade is a transitional year when students build on the content standards from the primary grades by applying them to their community and the world. Students begin by analyzing local cities such as Ellicott City and Columbia, and students then expand to economic principles such as global trade and the concept of supply and demand.</p>

<p>Fourth grade begins with a historical focus on the early Native American societies and the goals of the early European explorers. The focus then moves chronologically from Maryland's initial settlement to the creation of the state. This includes delving into Maryland's role during the revolutionary war, the establishment of slavery and contributions of individuals in Maryland's history. Students then focus on the growth and change of Maryland during the nineteenth century. The final unit of study focuses on modern Maryland's characteristics, including the interactions between the people and the environment and the organization of the state political system.</p>

<p>Fifth grade also progresses chronologically by beginning with the study of colonial America. Students analyze the motives and lives of early colonists. They then learn about the causes of the American Revolution and the multiple principles and positions of colonists during the revolution. Students then analyze the principles and purpose of our government through analysis of the Articles of Confederation and the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention. Students then learn about the organization and functions of the three branches of government by studying principles such as federalism and checks and balances. Finally, students identify the rights and responsibilities of a citizen.</p>

<h2>Simulated Congressional Hearings </h2>

<p>The Simulated Congressional Hearing (SCH) is a culminating activity for fifth grade social studies. The SCH is an authentic, performance-based assessment where students demonstrate their understanding of the U.S. Constitution. Students display their expertise on topics ranging from colonial life and government to the contemporary rights and responsibilities of citizens in our country. The students present prepared oral statements before a panel of simulated congressional committee members ("judges"). Following the formal presentations, students respond to follow-up questions from the panel.

<h2>Social Studies Advisory Board</h2>

<p>The mission of the Social Studies Advisory Board is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Serve as a community sounding board for issues related to Social Studies education in Howard County.</li>
  <li>Serve as an advisory group for the adoption of new Social Studies textbooks and curricula.</li>
  <li>Advocate for the Social Studies program in a wide range of arenas, both public and private.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this committee is to offer staff advice from multiple perspectives on social studies decisions and future directions aligned with the Bridge to Excellence Master Plan. Committee members will review curriculum and new textbooks, participate in long range planning and goal setting, provide support for the social studies budget, and receive updates on professional development and student programs.</p>

<p>The Social Studies Advisory Committee meets three times during the school year. Anyone interested in service on this committee should contact Kim Eggborn, Coordinator of Elementary Social Studies or Robert Coffman, Instructional Facilitator of Secondary Social Studies.</p>
