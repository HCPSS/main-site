<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<img class="pict" src="/f/schoolplanning/rbes1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="189" />       

<h3>Renovation History</h3>   
<p>Running Brook Elementary School opened in 1970 with an open classroom design for grades K-5. The school was desgned as a single-story building with  masonry exterior walls.</p>

<p>The school underwent renovations in 1984 to enclose the open design and instead  create individual classrooms. A single-story addition, that included a gym and 2 additional classroom,s were also part of the renovations. Another renovation was  completed in 2006 that modernized all of the interior spaces.</p>

<h3>Current Project</h3>
<p>The current renovation project will address the continued population growth of Columbia West and Southeastern regions that affect the elementary school and better serve the expected influx of students by the year 2019. To address this growth, the project will provide 100 seats of additional classroom space by adding a 2-story classroom, cafetorium expansion and additional core infrastructure space necessary to operate effectively as a larger school. This expansion will also improve the utility and effectiveness of the existing academic support spaces.</p>

<p>Construction has started at Running Brook ES. The surrounding home owners were notified by a mailing about the public meeting being held on Monday, October 14, 7:00 PM at the school to discuss and answer any questions regarding the project.</p>

<h2>Stages</h2>
<div class="t">
<ol class="timeline">
    
<li class="tl-node"><h3>Concept Development Stage</h3>
<p>Using input from a School Planning Advisory Committee, the primary objective is to develop a schematic design recommendation that expands the size of the school by 100 students. Replacing undersized classrooms with ones that are more appropriate for large class size instruction was considered.</p>

</li>
      
<li class="tl-node"><h3>Design Development and Construction Document Stage</h3>
  <p>The HCPSS staff is working to develop a BOE presentation that will include both the Design and Construction Development plans for approval. These plans will be presented to the Board on March 12, 2012.</p>

  <ol>
   <li>Presented to BOE - March 12, 2013 (Board voted in favor of this combined design and construction submission.)</li>

  </ol>
      
  <p>The Maryland Public School Construction Program (PSCP) allows school system's to submit a combination Design Development and Construction Development plan on small projects and/or too expedite the bidding process. The Board approved the above RBES project on March 12 and has set a bid date for May 16, 2013.</p>
      
  <p>Prior to starting the planned additions at RBES, letters will be sent to property owners that surround the school within a determined radius dependent on housing density (e.g., quarter- or half-mile radius). The school system will have a public meeting to describe the school construction process to the neighborhood.</p>
