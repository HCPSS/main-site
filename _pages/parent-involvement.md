<p>There are many opportunities for parents and community members to learn more about and to become an advocate for gifted education.</p>

<h2>G/T Advisory Committee</h2>

<p>The G/T Advisory Committee is composed of parents, teachers, and community members from throughout the county who work support the G/T Program in Howard County. Dialogue groups at each level as well as various subcommittees such as gifted education legislation in Maryland report biannually to the steering committee to make recommendations to the G/T Office.</p>

<p>For additional information, please contact the G/T program office at 410-313-6800.</p>

<h2>Parent Academy</h2>

<p>The Parent Academy offers a <a href="http://hcpssgtac.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">series of workshops <img alt="new webpage" src="/f/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a> for parents and community members who want to learn more about gifted education.
