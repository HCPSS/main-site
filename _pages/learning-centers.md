<p>BSAP Community-based Learning Centers are committed to reaching out to serve and views every child as an asset to his or her community. We believe that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every child should have the opportunity to grow in a safe and nurturing environment.</li>
  <li>Experience wonderful and exciting things.</li>
  <li>Use their assets to achieve academic excellence.</li>
  <li>Young people should learn the skills necessary to interact with many different types of people, and feel empowered to shape the world around them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning Centers exist to provide daily experiences, to help youths build a strong commitment to learning, use their time constructively, develop strong social skills, and have a positive impact in their community</p>

<p>The focus of Learning Centers is to accelerate academic achievement with a primary focus on reading, mathematics and learning behaviors that impact student learning. Students receive assistance with daily homework assignments. They are also expected to read 15-20 minutes per day and participate in mathematics, reading, chess and/or computer activities.</p>

<p>Each day begins with a unity circle where students share accomplishments, discuss and/or review goals and recite the <a href="/schools/bsap/#sixp">Six Ps</a>. A healthy snack is provided daily. Family involvement goals for the Learning Centers are designed to include grandparents, older siblings, close neighbors, friends and mentors. Parent communications include newsletters, home visits, phone calls, family workshops, and on site conferences. Parents are also assisted in understanding their child's educational progress and are given opportunities to review and discuss interim reports and report cards from their child's school during Parent Information Meetings.</p>
