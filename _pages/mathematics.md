<strong>How to Think and Reason Mathematically:</strong>
<ol>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">Reason abstractly and quantitatively.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 8px">Model with Mathematics.</li>

<p>The Howard County Public School System's mathematics program is built upon the HCPSS Mathematics Curriculum. The mathematics standards set a rigorous definition of college and career readiness by demanding that students develop a depth of understanding and ability to apply mathematics to real-life situations, as college students and employees regularly do. In prekindergarten through grade 8 mathematics, the standards lay a solid foundation in whole numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Taken together, these elements support a student's ability to learn and apply more demanding mathematics concepts and procedures in middle and high school.</p>

<p>Howard County's mathematics programs call on students to practice applying mathematical ways of thinking to real world issues and challenges; they require students to think and reason mathematically.</p>

<p>Children mature mathematically at different paces, throughout each grade level, and demonstrate various levels of implementation of the practices. These behaviors develop over time and often emerge during certain learning activities and through the study of specific, critical mathematics topics and standards.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>In HCPSS, elementary mathematics content is organized by grade level. Secondary mathematics content is organized by course. The goal of the preK-12 elementary mathematics program in Howard County is that every student will graduate college and career ready.</p>

<h2>Parent Activities, Resources, and Tools for Elementary Students</h2>

<p>These resources are intended to help families support mathematics instruction.</p>

<h2>High School Mathematics Courses and Pathways</h2>
<p>Communication, connections, reasoning, problem solving, and technology are major strands in all mathematics courses. Courses in mathematics are worthwhile not only for students who plan to continue their education in college, but also for those students who plan to enter the work force immediately upon completion of high school. Specific math pathways detail graduation requirements as well as graduation recommendations to ensure college readiness.</p>
