<p>The Board of Education of Howard County believes that the education of children is a responsibility shared by parents, families, the school system and the community.</p>

<p>The Board recognizes the parent as the child&rsquo;s first and lifelong teacher and that it is essential to involve parents in educational decisions as caring advocates for their children. The Board of Education is committed to promoting the involvement of all parents of students in the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS), regardless of culture, religion, socio-economic status, race/ethnicity, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, primary language, parent/family education, geographical location or any other factor that may limit involvement.</p>

<p>The Board encourages collaboration with parents and the community as participants in school governance and as active partners in forwarding the school system&rsquo;s goals and philosophy.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is incumbent upon the school system and individual schools to establish programs and practices that cultivate a respectful climate, promote open communication, and provide opportunities for effective parent and community involvement and engagement.</p>

<blockquote>Adopted by the Board of Education of Howard County, Nov. 22, 1994 Amended:  Nov. 9, 2006</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, as part of its strategic planning process the school system has set as one of goals: Each school will provide a safe and nurturing environment that values our diversity and commonality.</p>

<h2>What is Parent Involvement?</h2>

<p>Parent involvement is the participation of parents in every facet of the education and development of children from birth to adulthood, recognizing that parents are the primary influence in children's lives. Parent involvement takes many forms, including the parents' shared responsibilities in decisions about children's education, health and well-being, as well as the parents' participation in organizations that reflect the community's collaborative aspirations for all children.</p>

<p>Howard County is deeply committed to developing partnerships among home, school, and community.  Partnerships create a shared responsibility for student success.  These unique partnerships are part of school improvement planning and goal setting for student learning. Our goal is for school personnel, family members, and community members to work together for student success.</p>

<p>Adopted by the National PTA Board of Directors</p>

<p>&quot;Countless studies have shown that children who receive consistent, loving attention from their parents perform better in school and lead happier lives than those who don't. Parents are children's most important teachers, role models and guides. They have a responsibility to stay involved with their children in positive ways, through school, family activities and daily conversation.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Joan Dykstra, National PTA President, 1996-97 and Howard County Parent</blockquote>

<h2>Types of Parent Involvement</h2>

<p>The Howard County Public School System recognizes parents as the first educators in the home, as partners with schools, and as advocates for all children, and fosters parental involvement in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Parenting</strong> - Assisting families with parenting and child rearing skills, understanding childand adolescent development, setting home conditions that support children as students at each age and grade level, and assisting schools to understand families</li>
  <li><strong>Communicating</strong> - 
  Designing effective forms of school-to-home and home-to-school communications about school programs, skills required to pass all subjects in each grade, and children&rsquo;s progress</li>
  <li><strong>Volunteering</strong> - 
  Recruiting, organizing, and recognizing volunteer help and support occurring in the school and outside of the school</li>
  <li><strong>Learning at Home</strong> - 
  Providing information and ideas to families about how to help students at home with homework and other curriculum related activities, decisions, and planning</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Making and Advocacy</strong> - 
  Including families as participants in school decisions and developing parent leaders and representatives from all groups</li>
  <li><strong>Community Collaboration</strong> - Identifying and integrating resources and services from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student learning and development</li>
</ul>
