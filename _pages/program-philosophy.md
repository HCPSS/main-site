<p>Beyond the goals and objectives of the curriculum, lies the real stuff of social studies, those experiences which develop in students a sense of civic efficacy. Good social studies instruction is meaningful, active, challenging, value-based, and cross-curricular. As students progress through the social studies program in Howard County, they will develop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A sense of civic responsibility and place value on active civic participation.</li>
  <li>Perspectives on their own life experiences as they see themselves as part of the larger human adventure in time and space.</li>
  <li>A critical understanding of the history, geography, economic, political, and social institutions, traditions, values, unity, and diversity of the United States.</li>
  <li>An understanding of other peoples and the unity and diversity found in the world's history, geography, institutions, traditions, and values.</li>
  <li>Critical attitudes and analytical perspectives of the human condition.</li>
</ul>
