<h2>Fine Arts</h2>

<p>The fine arts (theatre, visual art, music and dance) are among humanity's greatest aesthetic and intellectual achievements. They communicate a broad range of ideas and feelings, and have been a primary means of transmitting culture throughout history. Their persuasive powers influence an enormous range of human activities. The arts are an integral part of every child's learning and cognitive development.</p>

<h2>Theatre Arts &amp; Dance</h2>

<p>Theatre Arts provides the opportunity for students in Grades 9-12 to establish life-long relationships with theatrical expression. Theatre instruction combines the study of theatre history and dramatic literature with the development of interpretive and emotional skills.</p>
