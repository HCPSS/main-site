<p>The Howard County Public School System is committed to ensuring that all students learn in a safe and nurturing environment and that all policies are enforced in a fair and consistent manner. The Board of Education has developed a Student Code of Conduct to serve as a disciplinary framework that supports behavioral and discipline policies. All students are expected to be aware of and abide by this Student Code of Conduct. Parents are asked to read this Student Code of Conduct carefully and to discuss the information with their children. It takes all of us-school staff, parents and students-working together, to create and maintain a safe and nurturing environment that is conducive to learning for all children.</p>
