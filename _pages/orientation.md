<p>Supporting the Journey of Excellence</p>
<p>Each August the HCPSS holds a 3-day New Teacher Orientation (NTO) that marks the beginning of the Teacher Induction Process for new certificated, instructional staff. New staff members are introduced to the <a href="/vision/#vision" target="_blank">school system's mission, goals</a>, initiatives and commitment to <em>Excellence in Teaching and Learning</em>. They attend curriculum content sessions led by staff from the Division of Curriculum, Instruction, and Administration and master teachers, as well as systemic initiative sessions focusing on HCPSS <a href="/vision/support/#goal2">Goal 2</a>.</p>

<p>During the curriculum and program area sessions, new hires interact with central office staff members who provide ongoing support during the school year. They receive information about curriculum resources, recommended instructional approaches, strategies for successfully starting the school year and building positive relationships with students and their families.</p>

<p>During NTO week, new staff members also attend a half-day, school-based orientation led by school staff at their assigned school and are given opportunities to create classroom and instructional materials at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;q=5451+Beaverkill+Road+Columbia,+MD+21044&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89b7df6e8ba68af9:0x9605b21ccdd80afc,5451+Beaverkill+Rd,+Columbia,+MD+21044&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8RVSUemqH6ni4AOezoHAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA" target="_blank">Teacher Support Center, 5451 Beaverkill Road,</a> Columbia.</p>
