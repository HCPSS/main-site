<p>Academic Intervention provides students with either enrichment and/or intervention services to accelerate their achievement. Through enrichment classes, students are provided experiences that are extensions of the curriculum.</p>

<p>The purpose of intervention programming is to provide instructional support for children who are performing below level in reading, writing, or mathematics. These interventions are limited for a specific amount of time, are data driven, and address individual students’ instructional needs. They may involve additional instructional time during the school day, after school, or extended day/week/year.</p>
