<p>Maryland's Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) Initiative is a collaboration of the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), Sheppard Pratt Health System, and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This partnership, known as PBIS Maryland, is responsible for providing training and technical assistance to the local school systems in the implementation and management of PBIS.</p>

<p>Each of the 24 local school systems is a partner in the PBIS Maryland Initiative and provides leadership and coaching to support participating schools within its jurisdiction. In addition, ongoing technical assistance has been consistently provided to Maryland through the National Technical Assistance Center for PBIS. The implementation of PBIS is built upon the public health logic model of three-tiered prevention. Attention is focused on creating and sustaining primary (universal/school-wide), secondary (targeted/small group), and tertiary (intensive/individual) systems of support that improve the outcomes for all children by reducing problem behaviors and making schools more effective, efficient, and positive work environments for both students and staff.</p>

<h2>PBIS Recognition Awards</h2>

<h3>Bronze Awards</h3>
The first recognition level is the PBIS Maryland Bronze Recognition Award. This award is targeted to schools that are in the implementation phase for school-wide PBIS. The requirements are minimal and a school can only receive the award for 2 consecutive years.</p>

<h3>Silver Awards</h3>
<p>The second recognition level is the PBIS Maryland Silver recognition award, intended for those schools that have successfully implemented school-wide PBIS and can demonstrate that their implementation has had positive effects on their discipline data for at least one year. Since the application must be submitted during the school year, schools are required to compare a portion of the current school year with a month-to-month comparison, to demonstrate positive effects.</p>

<h3>Gold Awards</h3>
<p>The third and highest level of PBIS Maryland recognition is the PBIS Maryland Gold Recognition Award and will only be awarded to those schools that are demonstrating sustainability for the systems, practices, and data utilization for school-wide PBIS and can demonstrate that their implementation has had positive effects on both their discipline and achievement data for at least two years. Since the application must be submitted during the school year, schools are required to compare a portion of the current school year by month-to-month comparison to demonstrate positive effects. Schools that receive the Gold Recognition Award must be willing to participate in 2011 summer training events, either in the form of a presentation or a poster session.</p>
