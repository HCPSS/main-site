<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)</a></h2>

<h3>What is the advantage of studying a world language in 6th grade?</h3>
<p>The research clearly shows that language learning enhances performance, opens up new opportunities and provides perspectives to students who might otherwise not have encountered these experiences. The earlier a student studies another language, the better.</p>

<h3>Who is eligible to take a world language?</h3>
<p>World language study is open to students in Grades 7 and 8. All students will benefit from learning another language. However, students should carefully weigh the workload of an additional course and the loss of participation in the full Related Arts cycle.</p>

<h3>How often do world language classes meet?</h3>
<p>The world language class meets daily for 50 minutes.</p>

<h3>How do students select a world language?</h3>
<p>The study of any of the languages is beneficial; so when making their selection, students often take into consideration interests, prior experiences, family and friends, career goals, etc. At the time of selection, students should indicate a first and second choice of language. Every effort will be made to match students to their first choice.</p>

<h3>Can students enroll in a world language in Grade 8?</h3>
<p>World language study is a two-year commitment in Grades 7 and 8. Students who do not start world language study in Grade 7 may wait until high school to begin their language study at that time.</p>

<h3>When will students know their world language placement?</h3>
<p>Students will be notified of the world language placement when schedules are distributed.</p>

<h3>When do the world language classes take place?</h3>
<p>Students study a world language during one of the two Relate Arts periods in the seven-period schedule. Each year, students are required to take Physical Education, Health, and a Fine Art (Art of General Music). Related Arts schedules will be rounded out with Family and Consumer Science, Technical Education, or Reading Innovation and Inquiry Modules. Participation in a yearlong, music performing ensemble (Band, Orchestra, Chorus) may substitute for the Fine Arts requirement.</p>

<h3><a name="news"></a>What are world language classes like?</h3>
<p>Students learn a world language through a proficiency-based approach. This means that the focus is on what students know and can do in the language. Instruction is primarily in the world language for approximately 90% to 100% of the class time - and students are engaged in listening to, speaking, reading, and writing the language. They are expected to be active participants in and out of class.</p>

<h3>What is the workload of the world Language class?</h3>
<p>Students who opt to take a world language take an additional course and they make a two-year commitment to language study in Grades 7 and 8. The world language class includes tests, quizzes, homework, and project assignments. In addition, there are summative assessments that monitor progress. It is recommended that time outside of class be dedicated to practicing the language.</p>

<h3>How does the world language class count toward high school credit?</h3>
<p>Students who successfully pass the class and the end-of-course assessment will have the course recorded as "pass" on the high school transcript. Students must still take two credits of world language at the high school level if they choose the world language option for their Program Choice for graduation (the other three options are American Sign Language, Advanced Technology, or Career Academy).</p>
