<p>Licensure of professional education personnel by the State is established to offer assurance to the citizens of the State that:</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Professional public educational staff possess the minimum essential knowledge and skills needed to achieve outcomes for public education declared by the State Board of Education;</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong> Academically successful, multiply talented, and ethnically and experientially diverse individuals are being sought and retained by local school system and licensed education personnel maintain competent practice through career long engagement with their content area, research, best practices, and expert opinion.</p>

<p><em>Article 2-205, 2-303(g) and 6-701-6-705, Annotated Code of Maryland</em></p>

<p>Teaching credentials are important documents.  Keep all documents pertaining to certification in one file in a safe, but convenient place (e.g., teaching certificates, CPD forms, transcripts, PRAXIS score reports, etc.).</p>

<p>Maryland certificates are issued with either a January or July date.  Maryland does not issue permanent certificates. Click on the links below for more information.</p>
