<p>The G/T Research Program includes two college-level courses, Independent Research and Intern/Mentor, in which students design an original research study or creative production in a self-selected area of interest. Student research or creative production focuses on contributing new knowledge to the field of study.</p>

<p>The G/T Resource Teacher facilitates classroom and internship experiences, focusing on advanced-level research methodologies, college-level writing,and oral presentation skills. Students in the Independent Research course receive professional feedback from project advisors, while Intern/Mentor students study apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in an authentic, professional environment.</p>

<h2>G/T Independent Research</h2>

<h2>G/T Intern/Mentor Program</h2>
<p><img class="pict" src="/f/academics/gt/high/research2.gif" alt="" width="250" height="170" /><br>Mentors provide students with expert professional guidance in a particular field of study. The mentor helps the student identify an authentic problem and guides the student with the development of discipline-specific skills needed to conduct the research.</p>

<p>Students are expected to develop an advanced product for presentation to an appropriate audience. Mentors offer guidance in specific disciplines, such as: Applied Arts, Behavioral Sciences, Business, Clinical Medicine, Computer Science, Education, Engineering, Humanities, Languages, Law, Mass Communication, Performing Arts, Science Research, and Veterinary Medicine.</p>

<h2>Student Learning Conference</h2>

<p>Each year, Howard County Public School System's G/T Education  Program sponsors an annual Student Learning Conference offering an array of scholarly presentations to showcase the college-level academic research pursued by students participating in the G/T Research Program. Students from each high school participate in this professional conference to understand the role of research in the &quot;real world&quot; and gain knowledge from each presentation.</p>

</ul>

<p>Beginning with a keynote address, students then attend concurrent sessions, listening to their peers synthesize their year of learning and contributions they have made to their various fields of study. The conference ends with a showcase of visual and performing arts to represent the multiplicity of students' gifts and talents.</p>
