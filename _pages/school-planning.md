<h2>Feasibility Study, June 2014</h2>

<h2>Approved Redistricting for the 2014-15 School Year</h2>

<p>The plan focuses on redistricting needed to open Middle School (MS) #20.</p>

<p>An online survey was conducted to gather public feedback on the redistricting plan. Below are the results from the survey.</p>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_C1AFKqRUDnQTI2WGwxTW9pd00/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Citizen Feedback on Redistricting - Results from the Online Survey July 19 - October 1, 2013 </a>

<p>The middle school redistricting plan including MS #20 balances capacity utilization and provides much needed relief to nearby crowded middle schools such as Elkridge Landing, Bonnie Branch, Mayfield Woods, as well as Murray Hill.</p>

<p>After the June 2013 Feasibility Study was published, the Attendance Area Committee (AAC) concluded with a plan that was similar in scope to the June 2013 Feasibility Study, but different in a few key areas. Both of these plans would have moved more than 1,100 middle school students.</p>

<p>The final Superintendent's plan incorporates additional community input gathered via the web or in regional meetings.</p>

<p>Following a series of public hearings and work sessions that began on October 29, 2013, the Board approved the 2014-2015 attendance area adjustments on November 21, 2013.</p>

<p>The 2014-2015 Redistricting Process Timeline breaks down decisions made by the AAC, and contains the final Superintendent's Plan.</p>

<h2>Attendance Area Adjustment Process</h2>

<p>When redistricting is planned, the attendance areas adjustment process for the HCPSS begins in the spring with the appointment of the <a href="/school-planning/aac-process/">Attendance Area Committee (AAC</a>) by the Superintendent. The AAC reviews and comments on the attendance area plans. The AAC also reviews and comments on the current capital budget and Capital Improvement Plan in conjunction with anticipated redistricting. The AAC's input is taken into consideration when developing the Superintendent's Attendance Area Adjustment Recommendation.</p>
