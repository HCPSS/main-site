<h2>Delta Dental PPO</h2>

<p>HCPSS will continue to offer the Delta Dental PPO Plan. The Delta Dental PPO has a national network of dentists with no need to select a primary dentist. With this plan each enrolled family member receives up to $2,000 for PPO and Premier providers in paid benefits per calendar year. When you use a provider with in the PPO network, you receive the highest level of coverage with the least amount of out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> You may choose to use dentists outside of the network, but your costs may be higher.</p>

<h2>CIGNA Dental Care HMO</h2>

<p>HCPSS has added Cigna Dental Care HMO as a dental HMO option for HCPSS employees beginning January 1, 2012. This plan provides low out-of-pocket costs and no claim forms. You can get up to two free dental cleanings a year, and two more at a minimal co-pay. You'll also receive a Patient Charge Schedule, which lists all of the dental procedures covered by your plan, and any out-of-pocket costs you may run into. With CIGNA we will now enjoy National Network of DHMO providers.</p>

<p>You will need to select a primary care dentist (PCD). If no PCD is selected one will be chosen for you. You are responsible for staying in the network.</p>
