<h2>What is the HCPSS PreK-5 WoRLD program?</h2>
<p>The Pre-K-5 WoRLD (World Readiness through Language Development) is the HCPSS daily, World Language instructional program for students in grades PreK to 5. In the current program, elementary students learn Spanish through the five C's: Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities as outlined by the American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages. The program is a sequential language learning experience, building toward language proficiency while exploring the culture of Spanish-speaking countries. Students receive 20 - 30 minutes of daily instruction in Spanish in an immersion setting. The goal of the program is to build communicative skills in the target language while making transdisciplinary connections. This program is being piloted at Ducketts Lane Elementary School (DLES) in grades K-2 during the 2013-2014 school year.</p>

<h2>What are the goals of the HCPSS Elementary World Language Program?</h2>
<p>The goal of the program is to build communicative skills in the target language, working toward Intermediate level proficiency. Additional program goals include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supporting academic content area instruction</li>
  <li>Enhancing literacy development in both English and the target language</li>
  <li>Promoting global awareness and cross-cultural understanding</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the plans for the expansion of the HCPSS PreK-5 WoRLD program?</h2>
<p>During the 2014-2015 school year, the plans are for the Ducketts Lane Elementary School pilot to expand to grades 3-5 and include PreK. Five schools will be added to the pilot in 2014-2015: Bryant Woods Elementary, Phelps Luck Elementary, Running Brook Elementary, Stevens Forest Elementary, and Talbott Springs Elementary Schools, where the HCPSS PreK WoRLD program will be implemented in grades PreK-5.</p>

<h2>Why should students take a world language at an early age?</h2>
<p>Research informs us that those students who study a second language at an early age show greater brain development as seen through improved cognitive flexibility, better problem-solving and higher-order thinking skills. Students can derive other intellectual benefits which include: greater academic achievement, increased self-esteem, increased creativity, better communication skills, and greater cultural awareness.</p>

<p>These abilities not only help students achieve higher scores on standardized tests in other content areas, but provide all students the opportunity to build a foundation of basic functional proficiency that will facilitate the study of foreign language at the secondary level regardless of the language chosen. Consequently, this will help them to begin building the basic second language skills needed to succeed in the 21st century global community and become college and career ready.</p>

<h2>Here are more benefits for learning a foreign language at a young age:</h2>
<h3>Better and more advanced reading skills:</h3>

<p>Research suggests that children's knowledge of a second language gives them an advantage in learning to read. Their ability to apply the insights and experiences of one language to the other as well as the wider experience of language is beneficial.</p>

<h3>Gives brains a boost:</h3>

<p>Research into the effects of second language acquisition on children suggests that exposure to more than one language is an excellent way of flexing those brain muscles - and building them up too. Children who had been exposed to a second language from an early age have significantly larger density of "grey matter" in their brains. Grey matter is responsible for processing information, including memory, speech and sensory perception. So increasing grey matter by exposure to a second language means that language learning would be just like "taking your brain to the gym."</p>

<h3>Natural-sounding, native-like accent:</h3>

<p>Children are always mimicking what they hear, and are surprisingly good at it. They are uniquely attuned to slight differences in tone and sound. Their sensitive ears help them pick up on and duplicate the tricky sounds adults and even adolescents often stumble over. By starting early, your children can speak smoothly, confidently and more native-like.</p>

<h3>Greater grasp of one's first language - including a bigger, richer vocabulary:</h3>

<p>Most of the time we use our first language with little thought to grammatical rules or constructions. This is perfectly natural, but the experience of learning a new language can bring greater understanding and improved grammar to our first language. Knowing the way another language works encourages us to examine our own language's mechanics in a positive way. Students begin to make these comparisons early on. By being able to compare the two, students learn more than they would with one language.</p>

<h2>Won't English Language Learners (ELLs) get confused?</h2>
<p>No. In fact, Spanish speaking and non-Spanish speaking ELLs progress more quickly in the development of Spanish proficiency. Because of the transference of skills, the more languages a person understands and speaks, the easier it is to acquire additional languages.</p>

<p>For heritage speakers of Spanish, numerous research studies identify native language instruction as a pathway for supporting academic school achievement. The strategic use of the students' native language serves as a vehicle for the development of higher order thinking skills. When an English Language Learner's native language is valued as an assist for academic achievement, they are more likely to have increased self-esteem and greater self-efficacy.</p>

<h2>Why do the Elementary World Language teachers speak the target language throughout the class?</h2>
<p>Awareness of how languages are learned is a part of the essential background of any language teacher. Second language acquisition proceeds according to predictable stages. Research informs us that children learn language best:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When meaning can be communicated in the second language without the use of the native language (English)</li>
  <li>Through extended listening experiences and negotiation of meaning</li>
  <li>When the language is used in a relevant, meaningful context</li>
</ul>

<p>The pedagogical foundation of the HCPSS World Language Program is the immersion approach, where teachers strive to conduct their classes using the target language 90-100% of the time.</p>

<h2>It seems like the students in the Elementary World Language classes sing many songs and play games. Is it pedagogically sound?</h2>
<p>Teaching young children a new language may appear as fun and games, but behind the fun are learning objectives and serious strategy to engage young minds and connect them to the language. Children in a school setting will acquire language best through thematic, integrative approaches that incorporate the content of the general curriculum and use tasks appropriate to their developmental level. Teachers use visuals, gestures, movement, and other methods to communicate meaning and plan instructional activities that appeal to multiple intelligences and learning styles. Regardless of age, second language learning should be meaningful, relevant, and fun.</p>

<h2>My child is transferring to a school with the Elementary World Language program from one that did not have a program. Will she need a tutor to catch up?</h2>
<p>Students in Elementary Spanish classes are using a program called Descubre el espanol con Santillana. The structure of the Descubre materials affords multiple entry points for students. At each level, the student book begins with an introductory unit, assuming students enter the program with zero knowledge of Spanish, and the remaining units are sequential, spiraling within the grade level. Each level of the program moves at a faster pace, allowing for the recycling and expansion of acquired vocabulary and skills. Also, the cultural perspective of the material changes from level to level, so students who are in a second or third year of World Language will be able to recycle and master previously-learned vocabulary, while still being exposed to new vocabulary and cultural perspectives.</p>

<h3>Units of instruction are as follows:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Unit 1: Nos conocemos (Getting to know each other)</li>
  <li>Unit 2: Como vivimos (Our daily lives)</li>
  <li>Unit 3: Vamos a aprender (Let's learn!)</li>
  <li>Unit 4: Los animales (Animals)</li>
  <li>Unit 5: Nos cuidamos (Taking care of ourselves)</li>
  <li>Unit 6: Nuestro ambiente (Our environment)</li>
  <li>Unit 7: Profesiones/Como functiona (Professions and how things work)</li>
  <li>Unit 8: Nuestras celebraciones (Our celebrations)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why isn't the Elementary World Language class included on the students' report cards?</h2>
<p>Elementary World Language teachers use multiple forms of formative and summative assessments to assess their students' progress and use district-created rubrics. Those assessments might be in the form of projects and performances where teachers can assess students' skills in the areas of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Including a progress report that will be distributed with student report cards is being explored.</p>

<h2>How often will my student have World Language class?</h2>
<p>Full day PreK students have 20-30 minutes of instruction daily, Half day PreK students have 15-20 minutes of instruction two times per week, and grades K-5 have 20-30 minutes of daily instruction.</p>

<h2>How can parents support their student's learning in Spanish?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>By going onto the online textbook and resources with their student. The student portal can be accessed at <a href="http://online.descubreelespanol.com/login">http://online.descubreelespanol.com/</a>. Students use their user names and passwords to enter the site.
