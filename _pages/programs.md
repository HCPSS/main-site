<h2>Early Intervention Services</h2>
<p>Early intervention services are designed to provide a program of educational intervention directly to the student with disabilities from birth to five years of age, to the parent, or both. Additional information regarding early intervention programs is available from the Instructional Facilitator for Early Intervention Services at 410-313-7017.</p>

<h2>Early Beginnings Program</h2>
<p>The Early Beginnings Program serves children from birth to three years of age who have a developmental delay or who are at risk for developmental delay. The program is part of the Howard County Infants and Toddlers Program (HCITP), a coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of services for infants, toddlers, and their families. Other agencies participating in the HCITP are the Howard County Health Department and the Howard County Department of Social Services.Every child who is birth through 2 years of age is eligible for evaluation and assessment to identify health and developmental needs in the areas of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hearing</li>
  <li>Cognitive development</li>
  <li>Speech</li>
  <li>Social-Emotional development</li>
  <li>Language</li>
  <li>Self-help skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Early intervention services are designed in the areas of physical, cognitive, communication, social or emotional, or adaptive development. Early Beginnings Program staff members use a routines-based and activities-based intervention model to help parents learn and use techniques that will facilitate their children's development. The services are provided in the child's home, at school, in child-care settings, or in community environments. Early intervention services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Family education, counseling, and support</li>
  <li>Early identification, screening, and assessment</li>
  <li>Special instruction</li>
  <li>Health services necessary for benefit from services</li>
  <li>Speech-language pathology and audiology services</li>
  <li>Community Health nursing</li>
  <li>Occupational therapy</li>
  <li>Social work services</li>
  <li>Physical therapy</li>
  <li>Vision services</li>
  <li>Psychological services</li>
  <li>Assistive technology devices and services</li>
  <li>Service coordination</li>
  <li>Nutrition services</li>
  <li>Home visits</li>
  <li>Transportation</li>
  <li>Medical services for diagnosis or evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>A team is designated to work with the family to develop the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). The IFSP, which is developed for each eligible child, describes outcomes and activities that parents feel are important for the child and family. Outcomes reflect the changes families would like to see for their child based on needs. Parents are active participants in developing IFSPs and implementing the intervention programs.</p>

<h2>Preschool-Kindergarten Program</h2>
<p>The Preschool-Kindergarten Program is a part of the Howard County Public School System's Special Education Program. The program serves children who are three through five years of age who have a disability or developmental delay. Three and four year old children receive special education and related services in four or five day preschool classes with typically developing peers or in community-based preschool programs. These preschool classes are included in Regional Early Childhood Centers located at elementary schools throughout the county. Kindergarten age children generally receive services in team taught general education kindergarten classes.</p>

<p>What are the Services?</p>

<p>Team members provide instruction and therapy services using techniques that combine sound principles of early childhood special education, developmentally appropriate practices, and applied behavioral analysis. Active learning, child choice, highly motivating materials, and positive behavioral supports are key to facilitating children's growth in developmental areas. Personalized programs are developed by school team members and parents to accelerate children's development of language, literacy, mathematics, social interaction, and motor skills.</p>

<h2>PALS: Community Based Preschool Services</h2>
<p>The PALS goal is to provide services to children with disabilities in the community based programs chosen by their families. To facilitate their success, we desire to provide the necessary supports and training to teachers and parents.</p>

<h2>Multiple Intense Needs Classes</h2>
<p>Toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergarten children who have moderate to severe delays in cognition, social interaction, communication, and behavior may receive services through Multiple Intense Needs Classes (MINC). These classes are located in Regional Early Childhood Centers throughout Howard County. Approximately four to five children with disabilities and four to five typically developing children are included in each class.Staff members use an incidental teaching approach that incorporates principles of applied behavior analysis to help children develop skills. Instruction is embedded in identified routines and activities to provide multiple opportunities for the children to practice skills. Other instructional strategies may be selected based on the developmental level of the child; the child's learning style, strengths, and needs; and the skill or task to be learned.Family members actively participate in the children's intervention programs. The focus of parent training is on using incidental teaching and family guided routines-based intervention. Family Intervention Specialists provide intensive training to families in implementing instructional and behavioral support plans.</p>

<h2>Family  Network</h2>
<p>Family Support Network Coordinators are available to provide information, support, and linkages to community resources for families of children from birth through five years of age. In addition, they coordinate a parent training program as well as a parent mentor program which links &quot;experienced&quot; parents of children with disabilities with those parents of children who are new to the programs.</p>

<h2>Academic Life Skills Programs</h2>
<p>High SchoolAcademic Life Skills (ALS) programs are located in each of the county high schools. In addition, regional programs for students with more intensive needs are located at Atholton High and Oakland Mills High.
