<p>The school system's capital budget funds the construction of new school facilities and provides for renovations, additions, roofing and barrier-free projects, technology equalization, and the purchase or relocation of portable classrooms for existing facilities. The budget document includes a capital budget for the upcoming fiscal year, a five-year capital improvement program, and a ten-year long-range master plan. Financing for capital projects comes primarily from three sources: local bonds, local transfer tax and state school construction funds.</p>
