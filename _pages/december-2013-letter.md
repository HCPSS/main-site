<p>Dear HCPSS Retiree:</p>

<p>As you may be aware, there have been many challenges in the implementation of the UHC Medicare Advantage Plan for our Medicare-eligible retirees and their Medicare-eligible dependents which is scheduled to go into effect January 1, 2014.  HCPSS staff and the retiree community have raised many issues and concerns.</p>

<p>These issues and concerns were first brought to United Healthcare&apos;s attention during the retiree information sessions held in October 2013.  HCPSS provided UHC with a reasonable amount of time to address these concerns.  However, as of this writing, the concerns persist.  UHC has not presented acceptable evidence that HCPSS retirees will receive the plan acceptance, medical coverage and claims experience that were required according to the request for proposal.    </p>

<p><strong>As a result and subject to approval by the Board of Education of Howard County, HCPSS and UHC have decided to suspend implementation of the UHC Medicare Advantage Plan for one year.</strong>  Subject to review, validation, and approval of the medical facilities and providers that will accept the plan, and a resolution of the customer service and claims process concerns, the new implementation and effective date will be January 1, 2015.</p>

<p>Retirees and dependents will be terminated from the UHC Medicare Advantage Plan effective January 1, 2014.  <strong>Please note that you may receive notice from UHC and/or the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) of such termination.  Any UHC card you may have received is deactivated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>All Medicare-eligible retirees as well as their Medicare-eligible dependents will remain in their existing (2013) medical plans with Care First or Aetna for calendar year 2014.</strong>  Retiree medical premiums will not increase during 2014.  </p>

<p><strong>There will be a Special Enrollment period for impacted retirees from January 21, 2014 &ndash; February 7, 2014.</strong>  During this special enrollment period, impacted retirees may elect to switch between the Care First and Aetna plans offered by HCPSS by completing the Special Enrollment Benefits Change Form.  Please refer to the HCPSS website for the CareFirst and Aetna Plan Overviews and Summaries of Benefits.  You may also contact the HCPSS Benefits Office to have these documents mailed to you.</p>

<p>In closing, this has been a very difficult decision for HCPSS.  HCPSS worked extremely hard with UHC to resolve the issues that were brought to our attention.  We appreciate the feedback received from HEART and the retiree community.  HCPSS is committed to providing quality medical benefits to our retirees.  We would not be the world class school system we are today were it not for the hard work and dedication of our retirees.</p>
