<h2>Merriweather Post Pavilion</h2>

<p>Entering the pavilion from Broken Land Parkway offers flatter terrain for less able walkers and those pushing wheelchairs. The South Entrance Road is hillier terrain.</p>

<p>Neither Merriweather Post Pavilion or the school system provide wheelchairs. To use handicapped parking, cars should enter from Little Patuxent Parkway.</p>
