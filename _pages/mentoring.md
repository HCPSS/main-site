<p>Novice teachers, new to the profession, are introduced to the benefits of Instructional Mentoring  during New Teacher Orientation and are carefully matched with mentors early in the school year to ensure they receive consistent support throughout their first year of teaching.  Mentors receive extensive training and support to be able to effectively serve new teachers.</p>

<p>&quot;Beginning teachers who receive regular support in their first years of teaching from a carefully selected, well-trained mentor often attribute their perseverance and increased efficacy to that support.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>New Teacher Center, 2011</blockquote>

<p>Instructional Mentoring is focused on support for new teachers with no prior teaching experience. New teachers determine focus areas with the support of their mentor and receive non-evaluative classroom observations with critical feedback at least once a quarter. Instructional Mentoring serves as one vehicle for applying the <em>2012 Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching Evaluation </em> and the HCPSS Vision of Exemplary Teaching for Student Learning to classroom practices.</p>

<p>Instructional Mentors are designated  central office program and school-based staff who engage in ongoing professional learning opportunities based on the standards of the <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org" target="_blank">New Teacher Center</a> and use research-based resources to support the mentoring process. Mentors interface with new teachers at least 12 times throughout the school year and focus specifically on the needs of the new teacher.</p>

<p>Instructional Mentors use the <em>Consult-Collaborate-Coach Continuum</em> to observe instruction and student learning, collect observation data or assist in the delivery of instruction with the primary goal of advancing the beginning teacher's classroom practice. We believe focusing on new teacher instruction and classroom practices leads  to effective teaching, which results in improved student learning.</p>

<p>As we strive to become a world-class school system, Instructional Mentoring will transform teacher practices and complement the many programs and initiatives that support our systemwide goals. As we welcome, support, and develop our new teachers, instruction will be improved and learning accelerated for all our students.</p>
