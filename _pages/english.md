<h2>Office of International Student and Family Services (OISFS)</h2>
<p>The Office of International Student and Family Services (OISFS) provides a variety of services to international students and to students and families who do not speak English proficiently. These services facilitate communication between home and school and ensures that the international students and Limited English Proficient (LEP) families have equal access to information about the school system and its resources.</p>

<h2>International Student Registration and Transfer Information</h2>

<p>Parents who plan to register or transfer their child(ren) to the HCPSS for the upcoming school year, should contact their designated home school or the ISRC before summer begins or as early as possible to complete the registration process by mid-August. Registration processed less than  two weeks before the first day of school may not guarantee the child(ren) starting school on the first day of school. To determine a child's designated home school, parents may enter their address in the HCPSS school locator to discover what school their child will attend.</p>
