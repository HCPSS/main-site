<p>There are two ways to add content areas to a current teaching certificate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One is to take and pass the appropriate PRAXIS II test.</li>
  <li>The second is 30 credits in the specific content area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other endorsement areas such as Administration, Pupil Personnel Worker, Reading Teacher, and Reading Specialist require specific graduate level course work. Guidance Counselor and School Psychologist require a Master's degree in the area.</p>
