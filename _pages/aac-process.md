<p>The purpose of the Attendance Area Committee (AAC) is to develop and evaluate potential school redistricting plans to advise the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The AAC is comprised of no more than 12 members, and may include residents from each of Howard County Public School's planning areas and one student representative. A staff member from the Department of Education will facilitate the AAC process.</p>

<h2>Committee Membership And How To Apply</h2>
<p>If redistricting is under consideration, the HCPSS community will be notified through a variety of electronic communications (Web Site, Press Releases, eNewsletters, etc. ). Prospective plans must be reviewed by a committee comprised of Howard County residents.</p>

<p>Applications to be on the committee are accepted every spring. An interview process is used to recommend members to the Superintendent for consideration as members of the AAC. Members must be at least 21 years old (except for the student member) and be residents of Howard County.</p>

<p>Members are appointed by the Superintendent to provide advice and comment during the planning phase regarding Capital Budget and redistricting recommendations being developed by staff. </p>

<p>Committee members are asked to volunteer their time by attending approximately 5-6 evening meetings. If redistricting is deferred, the pool of citizens who have expressed interest will be retained for the following year.</p>
