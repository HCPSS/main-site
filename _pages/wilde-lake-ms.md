<h2>Project Summary</h2> 
<h3>Renovation History</h3>        
<p>Wilde Lake Middle School opened in 1969 with an open classroom design for Grades 6 - 8. The school is a single story building with masonry exterior wall construction. The school has had one building addition and one major renovation in 1975 and 1996 respectively.</p>
 
<h3>Current Project</h3>
<p>Wilde Lake Middle School specifically serves the Town Center of Columbia so it is important that the school prepare to meet the demands of the higher student population as Columbia continues to grow. Due to the predicted increase in student population, the need to reallocate program spaces inside of the school, and various systemic needs of the building, we have investigated three options for the project including a limited renovation and addition, a major renovation and addition, and a replacement school.</p>
 
<p>Based on lower life cycle costs, improvements to the building and site, and a potentially lower local funding contribution, a replacement school is recommended. The replacement school would be built on Wilde Lake Middle School property and would be one of only three net zero energy schools in the state of Maryland.</p>
