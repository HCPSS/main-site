<h2>Target Population</h2>

<p>As with any BSAP initiative, Black students are the Achievement Liaison's primary target population. However, the criteria for referring and selecting students for the Achievement Liaison's formal focus group are based on need, not race. BSAP Achievement Liaisons may provide services to any student who meets the selection criteria regardless of race or ethnicity. Students are referred to the Achievement Liaison by their teachers and/or by their school administrators.</p>
