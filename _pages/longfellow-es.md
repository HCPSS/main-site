<h2>Project Summary</h2> 

<img class="pict" src="/f/schoolplanning/longfellow_pic1.jpg">
     
<p>It has been determined that Longfellow Elementary School is in need of renovations to improve the overall condition of the school and to meet applicable codes including the   International Building Code, National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Additional goals of the project include providing and increasing natural light throughout the building, providing better air circulation, and increasing the security of the school by building a secured vestibule. More information about the objectives and goals of the renovation project can be found on page 5 of  the <a href="/f/schoolplanning/lfes/lfes_feasibilitystudy_062612.pdf">Renovation Feasibility Study</a>.</p>

<p>Longfellow Elementary is located on a tight nine-acre site and is surrounded by residential communities. The original building opened in 1969, was renovated in 1986, with additions constructed in 1993 and 2007. The site constraints of the building in relation to the property and building restriction lines, make using a large number of temporary classrooms challenging.</p>
