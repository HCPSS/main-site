<h2><a name="records"></a>Confidentiality of Student Records</h2>
<p><a href="/board/policies/9000-series/">(Policy 9050</a>)</p>

<p>Student records are accumulated and maintained by teachers and other school personnel in accordance with the Public School Laws of Maryland and the rules and regulations of the Maryland State Board of Education.</p>

<p>Parents have the right to inspect and review all official school records of their child. Requests by parents for access to their child's records will be granted within a reasonable time and at the mutual convenience of the parent and school principal. This right is also extended to any student 18 years of age or older.</p>

<p>Each school will furnish parents an opportunity to request amendment of the records and/or challenge the content of their child's school records should they believe the records are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the program or other rights of their child.</p>

<p>No school will release records of students without written consent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization except as permitted within the law.</p>

<p>A noncustodial parent has the same rights as a custodial parent unless the  custodial parent has presented evidence of a binding, legal instrument (such as a court order governing divorce, separation, or custody) which specifically states that the noncustodial parent not be informed of or have access to the educational records of the student. If not specifically stated, both parents shall be considered to have this right. Except as stated above, noncustodial parents have the right, upon request, to receive school-related information and to be informed of their child's educational progress, including the right to receive report cards and to attend parent-teacher conferences.</p>

<h2><a name="directory"></a>Directory Information</h2>
<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Public Law 93-380) authorizes local school systems to disclose certain information from the educational records of a student that is designated as directory information. This designation includes basic biographical information only. It does not include student grades, test results, or any part of a student's academic or discipline records. Based on categories designated by the federal government, the Howard County Public School System's definition of directory information includes the following student data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li>Telephone listing </li>
  <li>Date of birth </li>
  <li>Major field of study</li>
  <li>Participation in officially recognized activities and sports</li>
  <li>Weight and height of members of athletic teams</li>
  <li>Dates of attendance</li>
  <li>Degrees and awards received</li>
  <li>Most recent previous educational agency or institution attended.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Maryland law permits the release of a student's home address and phone number to the following persons or organizations ONLY: </p>

<ul>
  <li>An organization of parents, teachers, students, or former students, or any combination of those groups, of the school (e.g. PTA/PTSA, booster club, class reunion committee, etc.);</li>
  <li>An organization or force of the military (e.g. military recruiters, etc.);</li>
  <li>A representative of a community college in the state; or </li>
  <li>A representative of the Maryland Higher Education Commission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parents/guardians have the right to restrict the school system from releasing any category of directory information about their child. At the beginning of each school year, parents/guardians should indicate their wishes by filling out the Option to Restrict Disclosure of Student Directory Information section on the Student Information Card on Aspen. The Student Information Card may also be obtained in print from the school office. If the form is not filled out, the school system assumes no restriction is placed on the release of directory information related to the child.</p>

<h2><a name="photos"></a>Photographs of Students</h2>
<p>In the course of school activities, school system staff and/or the news media may occasionally wish to photograph or videotape students for display/use intended for a public audience. At the beginning of each school year, parents/guardians may request that their child/children not be photographed or videotaped by filling out the Your Child and Media Exposure section of the Student Information Card on Aspen. The Student Information Card may be obtained in print from the school office.</p>

<h2><a name="research"></a>Research for Instructional Improvement</h2>
<p>The Howard County Board of Education believes there is a need for responsible research as a means of evaluating and improving the educational program in the schools. The Board also recognizes its responsibility to protect the instructional process from interference and to protect the right to privacy of students and parents. </p>

<p><a href="/board/policies/3000-series/">Policy 3030</a> governs research in the public schools. This policy encourages teachers to refine teaching techniques as a vehicle for improving the programs. However, studies that elicit home, family or personal information, or require one to act out feelings or emotions toward others are generally not approved but, if approved, require parental consent. </p>

<p>A survey by staff members for instructional purposes with no home or family information does not require parental permission.</p>

<p>The research policy also mandates that a parent/legal guardian give permission prior to a student completing a survey or questionnaire by an outside agency. </p>
