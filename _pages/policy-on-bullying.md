<p>The Board of Education is committed to providing a safe and nurturing school environment that values diversity and commonality. The Board prohibits acts of bullying, cyberbullying, harassment or intimidation, because these actions  compromise the learning environment and well-being of students, staff and community members.</p>

<p>Principals are responsible for ensuring that BHI Reporting Forms are available and accessible in the main office, school counseling office, media center and health room.</p>

<p>Forms should be submitted to an administrator in person, by mail or electronically. The administrator will investigate within 2 school days of receiving the form and implement corrective actions as outlined on the BHI Incident School Investigation Form and the <a href="/f/board/policies/codeofconduct13-14.pdf">Student Code of Conduct</a> <img src="/f/images/bullet-pdf.gif" border="0" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" alt="(PDF)">.</p>
