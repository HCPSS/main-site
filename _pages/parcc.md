<p>The state-led Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) is developing diagnostic assessments in reading, writing and mathematics to help teachers assess the extent to which students are on track to mastering the Common Core State Standards. PARCC is contracting with the Institute for Learning at the University of Pittsburgh (English language arts/literacy) and the Dana Center at the University of Texas, Austin (mathematics) to develop models of innovative, online-delivered items and rich performance tasks proposed for use in the PARCC assessments. These samples will include both assessment and classroom-based tasks. </p>

<p>Educators will be involved throughout the development of the prototypes, including participating in content reviews, piloting of the items and tasks, and participating in data reviews. It is expected that a portion of these tasks will be released to serve as models for PARCC states. The tasks will be piloted in Spring 2012 and made available in Summer 2012. It is  anticipated that the diagnostic assessments will be available Fall 2014.</p>

<p>PARCC has provided states with Model Content Frameworks that are being used to inform the development of item specifications and blueprints for K-12 assessments in English and math. The frameworks build a bridge between the Common Core State Standards and the PARCC assessment system and will be a valuable tool for states as they implement the standards in the coming.</p>
