<p>The Howard County Evening School Program offers alternative education programming to students from 5 to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights.</p>

<p>There are two components to the current program:</p>

<h2>Original Credit Classes</h2>

<p>A limited number of original credit classes are available to students 18 years of age and older who are trying to graduate from high school in a timely manner. This includes students who have dropped out and then returned to school, those with a history of academic difficulties who have fallen behind their age mates, and those who are having difficulty adapting to a comprehensive school environment.</p>

<h2>Classes for Students Serving Extended Suspensions</h2>

<p>Some students serving extended suspensions may be assigned to the Evening School program to receive academic and behavioral support services while they are suspended or removed from school for disciplinary reasons. These students take four core academic classes with work provided by the teachers from their assigned school, so that at the end of the suspension period, students may return to school without having fallen behind their classmates. All students under 16 years of age are assigned to this program during an extended suspension. Older students may be assigned based on individual circumstances.</p>
