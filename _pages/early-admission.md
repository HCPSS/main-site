<p>Early admission requests to Pre-K, kindergarten, and first grade will only be accepted for children born between September 2 and October 13.</span> There are no exceptions to this 6-week date-of-birth window.</p>

<p>Although early admission is rare, exceptions have been made only after a variety of items have been reviewed by certified early childhood educators. Detailed information about the early admission process may be found below.</p>

<h2>Early Admission Considerations</h2>
<p>Things to consider before applying for early admission:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All Howard County public schools have full-day kindergarten programs.</li>
  <li>Your child will be the youngest in his/her class, often a year younger than many peers.</li>
  <li>Entering school early is a decision that will have long-term effects on your child. The potential social/emotional impact on your child as he/she progresses through elementary, middle, high school and beyond is not predictable.</li>
  <li>Young children are emotionally vulnerable and may become stressed and anxious when adult expectations for their performance exceed their developmental capabilities.</li>
  <li>All children tend to learn best when they are appropriately challenged at a level for which they are ready.</li>
  <li>Although a capable young child needs to be challenged, those challenges should be closely aligned with his or her social and emotional development.</li>
  <li>When your child's peer group reaches adolescence and is old enough to date, drive and assume other young adult privileges, the same rights will be denied your child who is chronologically younger.</li>
  <li>There is evidence that children carefully selected for early entrance to school tend to do very well, academically and socially.</li>
</ul>
