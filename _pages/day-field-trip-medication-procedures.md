<p>Options for administration of medications for field trips during the school day include the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A medication order form completed by a physician/prescriber, nurse practitioner, or dentist is required for all medications, i.e., prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), homeopathic and herbal. Administration of OTC, homeopathic, and herbal medicines must be conducted in accordance with the procedures for prescription medication.</li>
  <li>Written consent of the parent/guardian for the administration of medication is required.</li>
  <li>A parent/guardian may accompany the student on the field trip and administer the medication.</li>
  <li>A single dose of the oral medication may be placed in a properly labeled envelope or container only by the licensed cluster nurse or school nurse, to be given on the field trip by school personnel. No other school personnel may package medication.</li>
  <li>A parent/guardian may bring in a single dose of the oral medication for the field trip in a properly labeled prescription or original OTC container to be given on the field trip by school personnel.</li>
  <li>The original medication (prescription or OTC) container, stored in the health room, may be sent on the field trip and medication administered from the original container by school personnel.</li>
  <li>Liquid medication that is properly labeled can be sent along with a copy of the order for administration, to be given on the field trip by school personnel.</li>
  <li>An inhaler that is properly labeled can be sent along with a copy of the order for administration. School personnel can assist the student in the administration of an inhaler.</li>
  <li>An EpiPen that is properly labeled can be sent along with a copy of the order for administration. An EpiPen can be administered by school personnel who have been trained to administer this medication. When an EpiPen is administered, call 911.</li>
  <li>Upon completion of the field trip, the medication and labeled containers should be returned to the health suite or the parent/guardian. A notation should be made on the student’s medication record that the medication was packed for the field trip and who took the responsibility for administering the medication.</li>
  <li>Parent/guardian volunteers cannot administer medication on field trips.</li>
  <li>Only students already self-administering medication as noted on their medication form can self-administer medication on the field trip. Consult with the cluster nurse at least one week prior to the field trip regarding these students.</li>
  <li>School personnel can administer oral medication, assist with inhalers and administer EpiPens (if trained).</li>
  <li>Only school personnel already functioning in a delegated relationship with the cluster nurse or a medically licensed individual can administer injections (other than EpiPens), nebulizer treatments, or other delegated nursing tasks.</li>
  <li>If injections, nebulizer treatments, or other nursing tasks are required on the field trip, an individual already functioning in a delegated nursing role or a medically licensed individual must accompany the student(s). Consult with the cluster nurse at least one week prior to the field trip so students with special health needs can be identified.*</li>
  <li>Health Services personnel must not be assigned to go on field trips, but are to remain in their assigned schools to address the health needs of the majority of students.**</li>
  <li>Schools should consider purchasing a cell phone for school personnel to use on field trips in the event that 911 or a parent/guardian needs to be called.</li>
</ul>

<p>* In the event that the cluster nurse determines that a medically licensed individual needs to accompany a student or students on a school sponsored activity, the following is suggested. Contact Temporary Employment to arrange for a nurse substitute. If a nurse substitute is not available, contact Care Resources, the private nurse staffing agency that contracts with the Howard County Public School System. Share with them the name of the school, contact person, that this is a field trip, the dates and times that a nurse is needed, and whether you need a registered nurse (RN) or licensed practical nurse (LPN) as determined by the cluster nurse. The phone number for Care Resources is 410-583-1515. The cost for the medically licensed individual may be obtained using funds from school fund raising activities, or using funds from the school’s third party billing allocation.</p>

<p>** Health Services personnel at Cedar Lane School may accompany students on school- sponsored activities as long as the health needs of the students at school are addressed by the remaining Health Services personnel.</p>
