<p>The library media center and its resources are available to every student and educator in the school system. Learning and teaching is fully integrated into the curriculum to promote students’ achievement of learning goals. The library media specialist in each school connects students and others with the information they need to engage in learning by providing intellectual and physical access to materials in a variety of formats.</p>

<p>In an information age, it is increasingly important to teach students the skills necessary to locate, use, synthesize, apply, evaluate and share information. These skills are in a PreK- 12 continuum as students gain increasing expertise through their school years. These information literacy skills are essential for student progress throughout the schooling process and are a vital component of lifelong learning.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of the Library Media program is to provide opportunities for students and staff to become effective users of ideas and information. The program is built around the principles in the American Library Association publication, Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning, the Maryland School Library Media Voluntary State Curriculum, and Standards for School Library Media Programs in Maryland.</p>

<p>Library Media curriculum closely follows the framework of the Big6 problem-solving model and is aligned with the school system’s information literacy initiative. It supports the learning of all students and promotes reading and use of resources for information and recreational needs.</p>
