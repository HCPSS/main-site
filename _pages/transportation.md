<p>In an effort to curb bullying and other behavior on school buses, the Howard County Public School System is <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/releases2013_10oct.shtml#news2013_64">installing digital camera systems on nearly half of its school buses</a>, with a goal to have cameras on all buses over the next few years.</p>

<p>Cameras already have been installed on approximately 100 buses, and another 110 buses will be equipped by the end of the year. Camera recordings will not be monitored, and only will be accessed when HCPSS staff believe it necessary to assist in an investigation.</p>
