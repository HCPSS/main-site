The Army JROTC Academic team representing Atholton High School and the Army JROTC Leadership team representing Howard High School were recently recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta for their participation in the 2011-2012 JROTC Leadership Symposium and Academic Bowl Championship, which took place in Washington D.C., June 2012. This event is sponsored by the Army JROTC and conducted by College Options Foundation.

The JROTC Leadership Symposium and Academic Bowl (JLAB) is a nationally recognized academic and leadership competition created exclusively for JROTC students. Cadets who participate learn the values of citizenship and academic competition while increasing their SAT/ACT scores; also increasing interest in college admissions, improving leadership skills and boosting team and unit esprit de corps. The competition creates tremendous opportunities for JROTC cadets by providing the opportunity to demonstrate the leadership and academic strengths of the JROTC program.

The Atholton High School Army JROTC Academic Team and The Howard High School Army JROTC Leadership Team competed against thousands of Army teams from around the world to advance to the Championship. The competition began with two fast-paced online rounds of qualifying competition, Level I - The Challenge and Level II - Zero Hour Threat. During these rounds, leadership teams and academic teams were tested on their knowledge of JROTC curriculum, English, Math and Science, using SAT/ACT- type questions. One of the main goals of JLAB is to prepare students for state exit/graduation exams as well as college entrance exams, such as the SAT and ACT. Other goals of the Competitions are to challenge cadets to employ their leadership abilities in task organizing, team building, time management, self-assessment, self-awareness and problem solving.
