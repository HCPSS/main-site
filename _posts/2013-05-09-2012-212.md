After winning first or second place at the Statewide Maryland History Day Competition in April, 11 HCPSS students will advance to the National History Day Competition, being held June 9-13 at the University of Maryland, College Park. These students have already won competitions at the school and county level, and were competing against hundreds of students from school systems across the state.

In addition to the students who are moving on the Nationals, six Howard County students won special awards, and Clarksville Middle School GT Resource Teacher Phillip Herdman was honored as Howard County's History Day Teacher of the Year.

Students presented entries in five categories: exhibit, performance, multimedia documentary, research paper and website. <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/2012-md-history-day-winners.pdf">View the full list of Howard County category winners and special awards</a>.
