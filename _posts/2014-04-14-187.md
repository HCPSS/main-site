The Howard County Board of Education adopted a revised Policy 9090 Wellness Through Nutrition and Physical Activity at the April 10, 2014 Board meeting. The Board first began reviewing revised policy in the spring of 2013, followed by work sessions, updated Board reports and two public hearings. The adopted policy can be found online at <a href="https://www.boarddocs.com/mabe/hcpssmd/Board.nsf/files/95KMVR572158/$file/03%2012%202013%20Policy%209090%20Wellness%20Through%20Nutrition%20and%20Physical%20Activitity%20BR.pdf" target="_blank">http://hcpssne.ws/BOE9090</a>.

With the revised policy, HCPSS becomes one of the few public school systems in the state to adopt Institute of Medicine (IOM) Nutritional Standards as its own.

Phase I of the policy was put in place May 9, 2013 and includes:
<ul>Breakfast is available in all schools.
	<li>Recess may not be taken away as punishment.</li>
	<li>Foods/beverages will not be offered as a reward or withheld as a punishment.</li>
	<li>Vending machines are allowed at the high school level only, after the school day ends. All selections must comply with Institute of Medicine (IOM) Nutritional Standards.</li>
</ul>
With the adoption of the revised policy, HCPSS will begin implementation of Phase II, which includes:
<ul>
	<li>IOM Nutritional Standards adopted as HCPSS standard.</li>
	<li>All food and beverages sold or given to students, including snack items, will comply with the IOM Nutrition Standards.</li>
	<li>School staff provided professional development on “brain break” strategies and activities.</li>
	<li>School celebrations involving food and beverages may be permitted by the principal no more than once per month after the end of the last lunch period, and must comply with IOM Nutrition Standards.</li>
	<li>Concessions are encouraged to offer healthier options, and to consider fundraisers that do not involve food and beverages.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, several areas will require long-term study and collaboration beyond policy involvement. These include recess, time for physical education class, intramurals, and after-school food sales.
