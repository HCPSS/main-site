<a href="http://www.hcpss.org/aboutus/superintendent.shtml">Superintendent Renee A. Foose</a> has released a report on the school system's progress since she took the helm of the Howard County Public School System in July 2012. The Entry Plan Progress Report outlines the status of the five objectives named in her original Entry Plan presented last June, and the steps she has taken in her first eight months as Superintendent, to move the school system forward.
