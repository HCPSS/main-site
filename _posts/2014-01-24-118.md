The 2014-15 school year will begin on Aug. 18 for teachers and on Aug. 25 for students, according to the academic calendar approved at the Jan. 23 Board of Education meeting. Winter break will be Dec. 24 through Jan. 2, and Spring break will run from Mar. 30 through Apr. 6. The last day of school for students is scheduled for June 10.

The approved academic calendar returns to the practice of adding any needed inclement weather make-up days to the end of the school year, rather than building inclement weather days into the calendar as has been done for the past two years. The last day for teachers is scheduled for Thursday, June 11, 2015, with inclement weather days to be added as needed through June 18, 2015.

The full 2014-15 calendar is available at <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/calendars/">www.hcpss.org/news/calendars</a>.
