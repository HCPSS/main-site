HCPSS will participate in the 2012 Chinese Bridge Delegation, sponsored by the College Board. Four HCPSS staff members have been accepted into the program:
<ul>
	<li>Linda Wise, Chief Academic Officer</li>
	<li>Deborah Espitia, Coordinator, World Languages</li>
	<li>Adrianne Kaufman, Principal, Marriotts Ridge High School</li>
	<li>Kathryn McKinley, Principal, Mount View Middle School</li>
</ul>
The Chinese Bridge Delegation is a weeklong program from November 7-15, 2012, that aims to help educators strengthen their institution's Chinese programs and partnerships. Highlights include school visits, cultural activities and educational workshops. Leaders from K-12 and higher education institutions are invited to apply for this unique educational trip to China as guests of Hanban/Confucius Institute Headquarters (Hanban).

The HCPSS delegation will have the opportunity to visit Chinese K-12 schools and post secondary institutions, meet with Chinese educators, observe classes and interact with students. They also will attend presentations on best practices and gather resources to build and support Chinese language and cultural programs. This opportunity will enable HCPSS to establish meaningful partnerships with Chinese education institutions and network with U.S. colleagues. The delegation looks forward to gathering information and contacts that can accelerate and improve our programs.

Over the last several years, the HCPSS <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/academics/worldlanguages/">World Language Program</a> has partnered with community groups and institutes of higher education to strengthen its existing languages and provide additional language opportunities for students as they prepare for a global community.  Participation in this College Board program comes at a time when study of the Chinese language has gradually been on the rise with expansion to six high schools. Several schools have established partnerships with districts in China. High school students are also able to acquire language skills in Chinese, as well as Arabic, Hindi, and Persian, by participating in the <a href="http://www.howardcc.edu/admissions/apply/hsinfo/earlyentrance/startalk.html" target="_blank">STARTALK Program <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a> at Howard Community College in the summer. At the elementary and middle school levels, the summer HCPSS STARTALK Program involves students in the exploration of the Chinese language in an immersion setting through marine studies. During the 2012-13 school year, Chinese will be offered at two middle schools and continued at the two elementary pilot schools.
