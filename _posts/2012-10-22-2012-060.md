Laura Collard, Director, Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education; Josh Feldmark, Director of the Howard County Environmental Sustainability Office; Meg Boyd, Director, Howard County Conservancy; and Raymond Brown, Deputy Superintendent for Operations for the Howard County Public School System, will offer remarks during the celebration, then will be joined by several state and local elected officials to present the certificates. Expected attendees include State Senators James Robey and Edward Kasemeyer; State Delegates Steven DeBoy, James Malone and Frank Turner; Howard County Council Chair Mary Kay Sigaty; and Board of Education Chairman Sandra French and Member Ellen Flynn Giles.

Green School Certification is awarded by the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education (MAEOE) to recognize a school's two-year effort to meet criteria in curriculum and instruction, best management practices, and community involvement in environmental education. Each certified Green School has engaged staff and students in initiatives such as implementing schoolyard habitats for reducing erosion and providing environmental study areas, designing energy and water conservation programs, and involving community members and partners in sustaining the environment.
