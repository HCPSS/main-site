Superintendent Renee A. Foose unveiled her proposed budget for fiscal year 2014 this evening during a special presentation to the Board of Education.

<a href="http://www.hcpss.org/aboutus/budget.shtml"><img alt="Child writing on chalkboard" src="http://www.hcpss.org/aboutus/budget_pic1.jpg" width="325" height="240" align="right" border="0" /></a>

"I am committed to giving teachers the resources they need, so that their time can be spent in the classroom helping every student achieve," Foose stated. "My promise to this community is that we are putting children first. If additional cuts are needed as the federal and state revenue streams become more clear, the very last place that we will take cuts is from the classroom."

The budget totals $721.1 million, representing an increase of 2.5 percent over the approved fiscal year 2013 budget. Of the total, $489.4 million is requested from the county, representing an increase of 1.5%.  Increase includes:
<ul>
	<li>$4.4 million to accommodate an expected enrollment increase of 550 students.</li>
	<li>$2.2 million for renovations and new schools, including a new elementary school to open fall 2013, and a   middle school to open the following year.</li>
	<li>Program enhancements totaling $1.2 million, including an improved academic assessment system, a world language teacher, a dietician, and four new community liaisons.</li>
	<li>A mandatory increase in the cost of employee health benefits totaling $15.5million.</li>
	<li>A total of $10.1 million in reductions were identified to offset the budget increase, including:</li>
	<li>A 10 percent, across the board cut to supply budgets, with the significant exception of supply monies allocated to schools.</li>
	<li>The elimination of 12 positions left unfilled after attrition.</li>
	<li>An $872,500 decrease in the transportation budget, reflecting efficiencies that more than offset an increase in costs.</li>
</ul>
Foose explained that the FY14 budget proposal comes at a time of transition for the school system. While implementing the Common Core curriculum, the system is preparing to roll out a new teacher and principal evaluation framework, and is investing in research and technology to ensure alignment of the pre-K through Grade 12 curricular and assessment programs with college and career readiness. Also underway is an ongoing evaluation of programs, initiatives and practices to ensure that investments in these areas yield the desired outcomes.

Foose also noted the impact of a challenging economic climate on the budget proposal. The school system depends on federal, state and local revenues, with 67.9% representing county resources, 30.5% from the state,and 1.6% from other sources. Local revenues directly reflect the health of the local economy, but Howard County, like the nation at large, has not recovered from the recession. The ongoing budget turmoil at the federal level, and tax increases for most Americans, further chills the prospects for economic recovery and has had a domino effect on funding decisions at the state and local levels.

Foose stressed that meeting these challenges, especially given the austere budget climate, requires channeling all budget funds to support the instructional process. Of each budget dollar, 80 cents is allocated directly to fund school staff and teaching materials; 5 cents to transportation, and 11 cents for facility operation and maintenance. Central Office administration and support accounts for just 4 cents per budget dollar – representing the second lowest overhead level among school systems throughout Maryland.

The superintendent expressed confidence in the school system's tremendous potential, emphasizing that new technologies, communication tools, and educational resources open exciting possibilities for the next generation of teaching and learning. But the system also faces unprecedented challenges resulting from exponential growth in recent years in the number and proportion of students impacted by poverty.

The Board will hold a public hearing on the budget on Thursday, January 31, beginning at 7:00 p.m., followed by public work sessions on February 5, February 7, February 12 and February 19.

The Board will approve both the FY14 operating and capital budget requests, and the FY15-19 Capital Improvement Program, at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday, February 21.
