The Howard County Board of Education will hold a regularly scheduled meeting at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, July 10, 2014 in the Board Room at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike in Ellicott City.

Both the afternoon and the evening session, which convenes at 7:30 p.m., will begin with a “Public Forum,” when members of the public may address the Board on any topic other than those for which a formal public hearing process exists. Advanced sign up is preferred. To sign up to speak at Public Forum, contact the Board's office at 410-313-7194.

Individuals who would like to request a sign language interpreter for any meeting of the Board of Education may contact Colleen Rice, Interpreter Scheduler, at 410-313-7046. A two week advanced notice is preferred.
