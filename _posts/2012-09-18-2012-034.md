The HCPSS received the Association of School Business Officials International's (ASBO) Certificate of Excellence in Financial Reporting award for having met or exceeded the program's high standards for financial reporting and accountability. The district was recognized for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ending 2011.

The Certificate of Excellence (COE) award confirms the school business office's commitment to financial accountability and transparency. Recognition through the COE program can help strengthen a district's presentation for bond issuance statements and promotes a high level of financial reporting.

The Association of School Business Official International, founded in 1910, is a professional association of more than 5,000 members that provides programs and services to promote the highest standards of schools business management practices, professional growth, and the effective use of educational resources.
