Members of the community are invited to join Talbott Springs Elementary School as it hosts a Green Apple Day of Service, a program initiated by the U.S. Green Building Council's Center for Green Schools, on Sept. 28, from 9-11 a.m. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn more about the school’s green practices and help construct a sensory garden.

This is the second year that Talbott Springs ES is participating in the program, which is centered on the Center for Green Schools campaign “we learn here, and where we learn matters.” The program uses the Day of Service as an opportunity to engage local residents in a greater awareness of the benefits of a green learning environment.

Those interested in volunteering can meet at the school on the morning of the event or register in advance at<a href="http://service.mygreenapple.org/page/event/detail/takeitoutside/4jv8k" target="_blank">http://service.mygreenapple.org/page/event/detail/takeitoutside/4jv8k</a>. The school also is looking for donations of painting supplies, such as paint, paintbrushes, drop cloths, and paint trays.

Several HCPSS schools are participating in Green Apple Day of Service events. Visit <a href="http://www.mygreenapple.org/dayofservice" target="_blank">http://www.mygreenapple.org/dayofservice</a> for more information.

The U.S. Green Building Council's Center for Green Schools was established to drive the transformation of all learning environments into safe, engaging, and comfortable facilities that enhance students' ability to learn and teachers' ability to teach. On the Green Apple Day of Service, advocates from around the world, come together in support of healthy, sustainable schools by taking action in their communities.
