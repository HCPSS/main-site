The Howard County Public School System and We Promote Health will work together in a new partnership that will encourage healthy, active lifestyles among elementary school students and families. The partnership will be formalized with an official signing Tues., July 23 at 8:30 a.m. at the Sheraton Columbia Waterside Restaurant, 10207 Wincopin Circle, Columbia.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, We Promote Health will provide interactive We Can! (Ways to Enhance Children's Activity &amp; Nutrition) workshops for students and families. We Can!, a national education outreach program designed by the National Institutes of Health, promotes family wellness and helps children stay at a healthy weight by improving food choices, increasing physical activity and reducing screen time.

We Promote Health also will invite families to participate in its We Can Move in the Park Saturday session and Howard County Family Wellness Day. Howard County Board of Education member Ellen Flynn Giles will join HCPSS Coordinator of Health and Physical Education Linda Rangos and We Promote Health President Brian Jolles to sign the partnership agreement at the July 23 event.

We Promote Health (<a href="http://www.wepromotehealth.org/">www.wepromotehealth.org</a>) supports the overall health and wellness initiatives in Howard County with a focus on promoting wellness in Howard County schools, workplaces and the community at large.

The Howard County Public School System's <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/aboutus/partnership">Partnerships Office</a> unites businesses and community organizations with schools to enhance the educational experience. Partnerships benefit schools, businesses, and the entire community by leveraging the resources of all participants. Partners may commit human or financial resources or other support.
