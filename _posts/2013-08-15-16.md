The Howard County Public School System today announced the launch of several social media sites. The new sites include:

· HCPSS Facebook – <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HoCoSchools">www.Facebook.com/HoCoSchools</a>
· HCPSS Twitter –<a href="https://twitter.com/HCPSS"> www.Twitter.com/HCPSS</a>; search for @HCPSS (previously used for emergency notifications only; now open to all communications)
· Superintendent Twitter – <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperHCPSS">www.Twitter.com/SuperHCPSS</a> ; search for @SuperHCPSS

“The HCPSS is excited to become a part of the already active Howard County social media presence,” Superintendent Renee A. Foose said. “Social media is increasingly a primary source of information. The use of these channels by our system and schools will allow for more constant, and two-way communication with our parents and community members.”

The establishment of a social media presence follows the recent approval by the Board of Education of revised Policy 8080, Acceptable Use of Technology and Social Media, which allows the use of social media to enhance both education and communications. Several Howard County schools also have established an individual presence on Facebook and/or Twitter.
