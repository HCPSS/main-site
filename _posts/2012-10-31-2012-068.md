Most HCPSS schools will open Wednesday, October 31, 2012, at the regularly scheduled time. Schools without power will remain closed.

Ten schools are without power at this time. They are: Bollman Bridge, Dayton Oaks, Longfellow, Tridelphia Ridge, Folly Quarter, Patuxent Valley, Wilde Lake MS, Glenelg HS, Hammond HS, and Wilde Lake HS.

Throughout the evening, utility crews will continue to work to restore power to as many schools as possible. At 5:00 a.m., an updated list of schools without power will be posted on the school system's website. Only those schools without power as of 5:00 a.m. tomorrow will remain closed.
