As part of his Explore and Restore Your Schoolshed initiative, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley will visit Dunloggin Middle School, renowned for its environmental education programs, on Thursday, Oct. 31 at 10 a.m.

Dunloggin is a two-time Maryland Green School, the only U.S. Green Ribbon School in Howard County, and one of the inaugural 78 schools selected as Green Ribbon Schools across the United States in 2012.

Among other activities during his visit, O'Malley will tour the stream restoration/wetland construction project area located behind the school where students regularly participate in stream clean-ups, invasive species removal, nature trail construction/ maintenance, planting of native species, water quality testing, and macro-invertebrate studies. He also will visit with students in the Oyster Gardening Group, who will make a presentation regarding their ongoing project of helping to restore the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay.
