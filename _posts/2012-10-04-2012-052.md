The BOE of Howard County regularly holds "Coffee &amp; Conversation" sessions at schools throughout the county. These meetings provide citizens with an opportunity to share a cup of coffee and chat informally with Board members. The meetings are held in various regions of the county but interested persons from throughout the county are invited to attend any or all of the meetings. The next "Coffee &amp; Conversation" session with the BOE will be held:
