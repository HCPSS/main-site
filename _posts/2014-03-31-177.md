The Howard County Board of Education will hold a regularly scheduled meeting at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 10, 2014 in the Board Room at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike in Ellicott City.

Both the afternoon and the evening session, which convenes at 7:30 p.m., will begin with a “Public Forum,” when members of the public may address the Board on any topic other than those for which a formal public hearing process exists. Advanced sign up is preferred.

During the evening session, the Board will hold a public hearing on the following:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Policy 9260 Student Search and Seizure</strong></li>
</ul>
To sign up to testify at the hearings or to speak at Public Forum, contact the Board's office at 410-313-7194
