Ninth grade science students from six Howard County high schools will participate in "Weather to the EXTREME," an experiential conference that enables students to better understand extreme weather, its relationship to climate disruption, and how best to handle an extreme weather event. The conference will be held on March 13, 2013, from 9 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. at the Howard County Conservancy, 10520 Old Frederick Road, Woodstock, MD 21163.

Students will rotate through six hands-on experiential learning stations located throughout Conservancy buildings and grounds, and interact with industry representatives from Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric; Bartlett Trees; TerraLogos Energy Group; REI; National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration; WBAL TV; Northrop Grumman; and University of Maryland Extension Service.

WBAL-TV meteorologist Ava Marie will serve as keynote speaker.

The event, the first educational conference of its kind in Howard County, is planned and organized by the Howard County Conservancy and the Howard County Public School System.
