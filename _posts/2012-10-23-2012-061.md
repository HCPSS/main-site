The HCPSS has been selected the Grand Award Winner among K-12 school districts in the 2012 Green Cleaning Award for Schools &amp; Universities competition, sponsored by <em>American School &amp; University</em> magazine, The Green Cleaning Network, and Healthy Schools Campaign.

One grand award winner, one silver award and two honorable mention awards were given in the school district category, with similar awards announced in the college/university category. An article describing the HCPSS practices that earned the award will be featured in the December issue of <em>American School &amp; University</em> magazine.

The HCPSS Office of Custodial Services began the process of "Cleaning for Health" in 2005. Setting a goal of reducing non-biodegradable waste beyond the levels required by the government, the HCPSS transitioned to use of low emission cleaning products certified by Green Seal or Ecologo. Subsequent improvements led to the system's recognition in May 2012 as the first public school system in the nation to achieve Green Seal GS-42 certification for cleaning and contributing to a healthy and more sustainable environment.
