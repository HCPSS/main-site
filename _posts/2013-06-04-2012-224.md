The Howard County Public School System is seeking individuals interested in serving on an <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/schoolplanning/committee.shtml">Attendance Area Committee</a>. Committee members will advise the Superintendent on middle school redistricting, which may be under consideration for the 2014-2015 school year.

Prospective committee members must be Howard County residents. The committee may include one student.

Participants attend approximately six evening meetings to review and provide feedback regarding Capital Budget and redistricting recommendations developed by staff. If redistricting is deferred, the pool of citizens who have expressed interest will be retained for the following year.

All letters of interest and resumes must be received by close of business Friday, June 21, submitted via email to <a href="mailto:Jennifer_bubenko@hcpss.org">Jennifer_bubenko@hcpss.org</a>Â or to the following address:

Howard County Public School System
