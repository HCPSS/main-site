Five Howard County schools have earned Maryland Green School status from the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education (MAEOE)

Bollman Bridge, Bryant Woods, and Guilford elementary schools, Harper's Choice and Patuxent Valley middle schools, and Hammond High School have been recognized as Green Schools. Hammond Middle School has earned designation as a Sustaining Maryland Green School after having been continuously certified since 2002. The new certifications bring the total number of HCPSS Green Schools to 43. A complete list of all current Green Schools can be found at http://www.maeoe.org/greenschools/listing/index.php.

Green School Certification is awarded by the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education (MAEOE) to recognize a schoolâ€™s two-year effort to meet criteria in curriculum and instruction, best management practices, and community involvement in environmental education. Each certified Green School has engaged staff and students in initiatives such as implementing schoolyard habitats for reducing erosion and providing environmental study areas, designing energy and water conservation programs, and involving community members and partners in sustaining the environment.
