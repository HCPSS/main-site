The 2014 HCPSS STEM Fair and Festival featured 175 projects from students in middle and high school. Volunteers from HCPSS and the scientific community donated their time and expertise to judge the projects.

Prizes were awarded for first place and runner up in six categories at both the middle and high school levels, and specialty awards were presented by several organizations. Outstanding student work also was recognized through the Dr. Lee Summerville Award for Biology and the Dr. Lynn Collins Award for Mathematics. Both Drs. Summerville and Collins served the students of HCPSS for many years, and the trusts to support these awards were established upon their retirements as legacies to their service.

Certificates of Excellence were presented to students in high school who entered mentored projects. Medals of Distinction were awarded to category runners up and trophy awards were presented to high scoring projects in all categories in at both levels.

The complete list of winners can be found online at <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/students/stem-winners.shtml">www.hcpss.org/students/stem-winners.shtml</a>.

The Fair was held in conjunction with the STEM Festival, where more than 1,000 people enjoyed 150 interactive exhibits from students and schools.
