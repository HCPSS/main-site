A delegation of art and social studies supervisors from Thailand, led by their minister of education, will be visiting the HCPSS on October 2-3, 2012. In partnership with the Maryland State Department of Education, the group is coming here to learn about our curricular programs in art and social studies. After meeting with the superintendent and curriculum staff on October 2, the delegation will be visiting classrooms at Howard High School and Ellicott Mills Middle School on October 3. <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/Thailand_Agenda_HCPSS.pdf">More info.... <img alt="pdf doc icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>
