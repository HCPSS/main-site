The Board of Education will meet in closed session at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 21, 2013, in the Board Planning Room at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=10910+Clarksville+Pike,+Ellicott+City,+MD+21042&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike</a> in Ellicott City.

At 4 p.m., the Board will hold a regularly scheduled meeting in the Board Room at the same location. Both the afternoon and the evening session, which convenes at 7:30 p.m., will begin with a "Public Forum," when members of the public may address the Board on any topic other than those for which a formal public hearing process exists.  Advanced sign up is preferred.

To sign up to speak at the Public Forum, contact the Board's office at 410-313-7194.

Individuals who would like to request a sign language interpreter for any meeting of the Board of Education may contact Colleen Rice, Interpreter Scheduler, at 410-313-7046.  A two week advanced notice is preferred.
