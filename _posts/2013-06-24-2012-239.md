The Howard County Public School System, Bright Minds Foundation and Lazarus Foundation are working together to provide computers to students who might otherwise not be able to afford one, and in doing so are repurposing equipment in an effort to conserve both financial resources and the environment.

The HCPSS, on May 15, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Bright Minds Foundation and the Lazarus Foundation to repurpose and distribute the laptops.

In early June, HCPSS provided 100 previously owned laptops to the Bright Minds Foundation, which will refurbish and provide them at no cost to HCPSS students who do not have other access to computers and otherwise would not be able to afford a laptop. The Bright Minds Foundation will subcontract the refurbishing work to the Lazarus Foundation.

"This agreement offers so many things to be proud of â€” most importantly providing students the necessary tools to achieve success in the classroom," said HCPSS Technology Department Business Manager Denny Moore. "It also continues our tradition of collaborating with Howard County business and nonprofit organizations, and contributes to the efficient use of HCPSS resources."

The Bright Minds and Lazarus foundations previously have collected donated laptops, refurbished them and distributed them to high school students. The most recent event was in May, during which Bright Minds staff trained students and parents on technology, online services, financial literacy and nutritional choices (photo attached).
