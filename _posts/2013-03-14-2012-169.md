The Howard County Public Schools System has been honored with the Sunshine Review's Sunny Award for transparency in regard to its <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/">Web Site</a>. The HCPSS is one of only two Maryland school systems to receive the award.

The editors of <a href="http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Howard_County_Public_Schools,_Maryland" target="_blank">Sunshine Review</a>, a non-profit organization that collects and shares information about state and local government, present the Sunny Award for transparency among state and local government websites.

For the 2013 awards, editors at Sunshine Review analyzed more than 1,000 qualifying government Web sites, comparing content available against what should be provided, including information on budgets, meetings, lobbying, financial audits, contracts, academic performance, public records and taxes. The winners of the Sunny Award all received an "A" grade during the extensive grading process.

This year, only 247 of the more than 7,000 government Web sites ranked by Sunshine Review earned a Sunny Award.
