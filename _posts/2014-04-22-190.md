Mt. Hebron High School was named one of the top schools in the nation by AFS-USA, which offers international exchange student programs. Mt. Hebron was the only school in the state of Maryland given this honor.

Schools honored with this inaugural award have partnered with AFS in a variety of ways to foster global citizenship through intercultural learning — both inside and outside of the classroom — from hosting international students, sending students abroad, and working with AFS-USA to incorporating intercultural and experiential learning opportunities into their curriculum.

On its website, AFS-USA said, “Mt. Hebron High School has consistently been a very cooperative school and supportive of AFS' mission. In just the past two years, Mt. Hebron has hosted 7 AFS students and we are very excited to work with them for many years to come!”
