Superintendent Dr. Renee A. Foose is holding four regional Listen &amp; Learn sessions with PTAs this spring. These sessions provide an opportunity for her to hear directly from parents about matters of importance to them regarding their children's education.

The first session was held last night at Wilde Lake High School. <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/newsletter/pta_listenlearn.pdf">Download information on the three remaining sessions</a> <img alt="pdf doc icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" />.
