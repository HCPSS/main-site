All 12 Howard County Public School System high schools ranked among the 50 top-performing public high schools in the Baltimore area, as reported in the Aug. 16-22 edition of the Baltimore Business Journal.

The list was based on the 2012 average total SAT scores for test takers at each school. The HCPSS schools ranked as follows:

1. River Hill (average total SAT score of 1758)
2. Centennial (1754)
4. Atholton (1692)
6. Mount Hebron (1676)
7. Marriotts Ridge (1671)
8. Glenelg (1659)
14. Howard (1597)
20. Wilde Lake (1574)
29. Reservoir (1537)
35. Oakland Mills (1507)
37. Long Reach (1493)
42. Hammond (1465)

“We are very proud of all our students for their stellar performances, which surely will open doors to bright futures,” Superintendent Renee A. Foose said.
