Black Saga is an academic challenge on African American history that will involve students from participating elementary and middle schools in Howard County. The middle school opening ceremony begins at 9:15 a.m. and the competition will conclude with an awards presentation at 11:30 a.m. The elementary school competition will begin at 1:00 p.m. and conclude with an awards ceremony at 3:00 p.m.

After working to enhance their knowledge of the African American experience for many months, the teams will compete against each other in a contest of their skills. All of these teams will then move forward to the state competition in March, where they will compete against students from other school systems. The Elementary and Secondary Social Studies Offices will host the local event.

In the event of a cancellation, the snow date for this event is February 23, 2013.

The district coordinator for the Black Saga Competition is Dr. Mark Stout, Curriculum Coordinator for Advanced Programs and Secondary Social Studies, Howard County Public School System.
