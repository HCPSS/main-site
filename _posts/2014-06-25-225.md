High school graduates in Howard County are more likely to enroll in college than graduates from all other state systems, according to recent data provided by the Maryland Department of Education.

Among Howard County Public School System 2012 graduates, 85.6 percent enrolled in college within 16 months of earning a high school diploma, the highest enrollment rate among Maryland systems and nearly 16 points higher than the state average.

The system is also the state’s best in college readiness outcomes for minority students, leading all other Maryland systems in the percentage of African-American (78.0 percent) and Hispanic (75.7 percent) high school graduates enrolling in a two or four-year institution. A little more than 70 percent of Howard County students receiving free and reduced meal services and 60.5 percent of students receiving special education services also outpaced their peers in continuing education.

“These numbers are possible because of the solid vision of our Board of Education and the commitment of our teachers, staff and community supporters,” said HCPSS Superintendent Renee A. Foose. “This report is proof in the power of building a vibrant learning community that engages and inspires students to thrive.”
