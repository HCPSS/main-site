The Howard County Board of Education will receive public input on a proposed land acquisition for a future school site during a public hearing scheduled Thursday, August 15, 2013 at 7:30 p.m.

The Howard County Public School System has made an offer to buy Oxford Square, Proposed Parcel G in Hanover, Maryland, for $8,200,000.00. The property is more particularly described as Parcel 1003 (formerly Parcel 761), Grid 20 on Tax Map 38 and is approximately 8.202 acres in area. The sellers, Kellogg-CCP LLC, have accepted the school system's letter of intent to purchase the property.

The property includes sufficient acreage to contain a school that meets the new educational specifications for an elementary school, including parking, playing fields, and accommodations for community use.Â  It would share a campus with Middle School #20, which is currently under construction.

The Public Hearing will be held in the Board Room at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike in Ellicott City. To sign up to speak at the Public Hearing, contact the Board's office at 410-313-7194.
