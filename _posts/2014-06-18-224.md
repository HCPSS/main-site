The Howard County Public School System is seeking Howard County residents to serve a two-year term on the Instructional Materials/Criteria Review Committee. The committee is responsible for reviewing selection criteria for instructional materials and revising the criteria, as needed. It also will review any requests for materials to be reevaluated. New members will be appointed in September and begin serving in October.

Interested citizens should fill out the application (<a href="http://www.hcpss.org/board/policies/instructional-materials-membership-citizens.pdf">http://www.hcpss.org/board/policies/instructional-materials-membership-citizens.pdf</a>) and send to Laurie_Berryman@hcpss.org, or mail to Laurie Berryman, Secondary Language Arts, 10910 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City, MD 21042 by August 24.

Information on HCPSS Board of Education Policy 8040 Selection of Instructional Materials can be found at <a href="www.hcpss.org/board/policies/8040.pdf">www.hcpss.org/board/policies/8040.pdf</a>.

Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. The HCPSS invites citizens to take an active role in reviewing and revising selection criteria for instructional materials. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on each committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives and ensuring transparency at every stage of the review and revision process.
