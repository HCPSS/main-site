County Executive Ken Ulman will toss a coin on the Atholton High School football field this Friday, August 31, to open both the school's first game of the season and the county's first on synthetic turf. The opening ceremony and ribbon cutting will begin at 6:50 p.m. on the field at 6520 Freetown Road in Columbia.

Ulman will be joined by Howard County Council Chair Mary Kay Sigaty and Vice Chair Courtney Watson; State Senator Ed Kasemeyer and Delegates Guy Guzzone, Frank Turner, Steven DeBoy and Elizabeth Bobo; Board of Education Member Janet Siddiqui; and Deputy Superintendent Ray Brown.

The Howard County BOE and Howard County Recreation and Parks approved a joint use agreement in May to provide for synthetic turf field construction and use at all county high schools. New fields at Hammond and Howard high schools will also open this Friday, with ribbon cutting ceremonies to be scheduled later in the season. Artificial turf will be installed at all other high schools over the next three to four years.
