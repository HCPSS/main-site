Parents and students are invited to join Dr. Katherine Newman, author of <em>Rampage: The Social Roots Of School Shootings</em>, a landmark study that challenges the "loner theory" of school violence and shows why so many adults and students fail to heed the warning signs that could prevent it, on Thursday, November 15, 2012, at 7 p.m. in the River Hill High School auditorium, in Clarksville.

A widely published author and distinguished academic leader, Dr. Newman is the James B. Knapp Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University.
