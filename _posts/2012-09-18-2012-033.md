The HCPSS received Gold certification from Healthy Howard, Inc. for the 2012 Healthy Workplace Program. The district was recognized for its HCPSS Commit to Be Fit Employee Wellness Program. Gold certification is the highest form of recognition and is awarded to programs that align with national recommendations for comprehensive worksite wellness.

HCPSS Commit to Be Fit Employee Wellness Program was restructured in 2012 with a mission to create an environment that supports and celebrates each individual's lifelong journey toward optimal physical, emotional, social, intellectual and mental well-being by providing awareness, education, motivation, and behavior change programs.

For the past four years, the Healthy Workplace Program has recognized Howard County businesses that are committed to improving employee health and well-being. HCPSS will be publicly awarded at a ceremony on October 17, 2012.
