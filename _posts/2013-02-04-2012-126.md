The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO) has invited the 104 student members of the Howard County Gifted and Talented (G/T) Orchestra for a Side-by Side concert on February 20, 2013 at 7:30 p.m. at the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall. The concert will feature works by Elgar, John Adams and Mahler. In addition, student soloist Alisa Hwang, winner of the Howard County Concerto Competition, will perform the first movement from Prokofiev's 3rd Piano Concerto.

Members of the G/T Orchestra, who are selected through a competitive audition process, prepared for the concert through preparatory rehearsals and master classes with BSO musicians.

The student musicians will join their BSO counterparts for the first time at a rehearsal on Tuesday, February 5 at the Meyerhoff recital hall. Soloist Hwang will rehearse with conductor Shizuo Kuwahara from 12:45-1:00 p.m., followed by the G/T orchestra rehearsing on stage with the conductor from 1:30-3:00 p.m., and with the BSO musicians from 3:30-5:30 p.m.
