The Howard County Public School System, as part of the Howard County Transition to Kindergarten Workgroup, will offer workshops for parents of incoming kindergarten students beginning this week. The Road to Kindergarten will help prepare parents for entering their child into the school system and getting them ready for kindergarten.

Attendees will learn expectations for school readiness; details about the kindergarten program; information on kindergarten registration; and ways that families and children can be supported during the transition to kindergarten.

Parents can choose to attend any one of the following sessions from 6:30-7:30 p.m.

- Tues., Jan. 28, Wilde Lake High School, 5460 Trumpeter Rd., Columbia
- Thurs., Jan. 30, Long Reach High School, 6101 Old Dobbin Ln., Columbia
- Mon., Feb. 3, Marriotts Ridge High School, 12100 Woodford Dr., Marriottsville
- Wed., Feb. 5, Hammond Middle School, 8110 Aladdin Dr., Laurel

There is no registration required. Sessions will begin promptly at 6:30. Childcare will be provided at no cost for children ages 2 and older. Those needing childcare should arrive early; sign-in begins at 6:10.

Incoming kindergarten students must be five years old by Sept. 1, 2014.
