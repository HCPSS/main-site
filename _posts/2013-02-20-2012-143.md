Janey Thornton, Ph.D., Deputy Under Secretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), will present the <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/HealthierUS/index.html" target="_blank">HealthierUS School Challenge</a> (HUSSC) Award to the HCPSS at the 4 p.m. Board of Education meeting on Thursday, February 28, 2013, in the Board Room at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike in Ellicott City.

In <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/releases2013_01jan.shtml#news2012_104" target="_blank">January</a>, the HCPSS was notified that all 73 schools had attained the HealthierUS School Challenge Bronze level of distinction by the USDA, for outstanding practices in school nutrition programs, physical education and physical activity.

Howard County is the only school system in Maryland to earn this distinction for every one of its schools, and is one of just four Maryland systems with schools honored.

The HUSSC is a voluntary national certification initiative for schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. It supports First Lady Michelle Obama's <em><a href="http://www.letsmove.gov/" target="_blank">Let's Move!</a></em> campaign by recognizing schools that promote nutrition and physical activity to create a healthier school environment.

The names of the award-winning schools are posted on the <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/HealthierUS/Maryland.html" target="_blank">HUSSC Web Site</a>.
