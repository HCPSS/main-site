The ninth annual Howard County Middle School Black Saga Competition will be held on Saturday, February 8, 2014 at Veterans Elementary School, 4355 Montgomery Road, Ellicott City. The opening ceremony begins at 9:15 a.m. and the competition concludes with an awards presentation at 11:30 a.m.

Black Saga is an academic challenge on African American history that involves students from participating Howard County middle schools. Students work to enhance their knowledge of the African American experience for many months, then compete in teams in a contest of their skills. Participants may then move forward to the state competition in March, where they compete against students from other school systems.

In the event of a cancellation, the snow date for this event is February 22, 2014.

The district coordinator for the Black Saga Competition is Dr. Mark Stout, Curriculum Coordinator for Advanced Programs and Secondary Social Studies, Howard County Public School System.
