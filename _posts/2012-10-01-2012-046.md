Chick-Fil-A, Johns Hopkins Road has agreed to form a partnership with Hammond Middle School in support of the school's PRIDE program. Through the use of positive incentives, PRIDE encourages students to make the positive choices and wise decisions that lead to lifelong well being. The official partnership signing will take place Tuesday, October 2 at Chick-Fil-A, 10975 Johns Hopkins Road in Laurel.

Under the terms of the partnership, Chick-Fil-A will provide letters of congratulations and free meal cards to be conferred by the principal to recognize students for outstanding behavior. The restaurant will also recognize Hammond teachers and other staff with a breakfast each year, and will support school fundraisers and other initiatives. Restaurant management will serve as positive role models for students through Career Day presentations and mock interviews.

At 9:30 a.m., Chick-Fil-A, Johns Hopkins Road operator Chris Schenck will join Board of Education member Brian Meshkin and Hammond Middle School principal Kerry Dufresne to sign the formal partnership agreement.
