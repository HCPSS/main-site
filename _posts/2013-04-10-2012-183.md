Wilde Lake High School was named one of the top schools in the nation by AFS-USA, which offers international exchange student programs. Wilde Lake is one of only two Maryland schools given this honor.

Schools honored with this inaugural award have partnered with AFS in a variety of ways to foster global citizenship through intercultural learning — both inside and outside of the classroom — from hosting international students, sending students abroad, and working with AFS-USA to incorporating intercultural and experiential learning opportunities into their curriculum.

AFS has 27 exchange students in Howard County schools for the current school year, five of them at Wilde Lake. The students are active in sports, drama, and a variety of clubs, in addition to numerous outside activities along with their host families

AFS wrote on its website, "Wilde Lake High School has consistently worked with the AFS Team in Baltimore to both host AFS students and send local students abroad with AFS programs. With their help, the Baltimore Area Team has become one of the strongest AFS teams in the East Coast region. They have been very helpful in making Baltimore Area Team one of the strongest hosting area teams on the East Coast."
