In August 2014, the Howard County Public School System will open its 20th middle school in Hanover, MD. Attendance and boundary lines must be adjusted in preparation for opening this new school, and the HCPSS strives to be efficient, equitable and strategic throughout this process. The system invites community members to learn about the new middle school and the redistricting that will be required.

Two meeting dates are scheduled from 7-8:30 p.m. on May 15 at Howard High School, 8700 Old Annapolis Rd., Ellicott City, and May 22 at Long Reach High School, 6101 Old Dobbin Rd, Columbia. The agenda will include an information session on the opening of the new middle school and a discussion session at which participants may provide input on important topics related to changing attendance areas.

Citizens may <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/hcpss.me/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFpETHptc1I4Q0xCcVlQWS1zQm1Gc0E6MQ#gid=0">register for either session or provide input online</a> by visiting <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/schoolplanning/">www.hcpss.org/schoolplanning</a>, where additional information about HCPSS redistricting is also available.
