In a new partnership, Cradlerock Elementary School and Wells Fargo will work together to teach students the importance of personal financial planning and the benefits of saving. The partnership will be formalized with an official signing Tuesday, Nov. 19 at 8:30 a.m. at the Sheraton Columbia Waterside Restaurant, 10207 Wincopin Circle, Columbia.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, Wells Fargo will create an in-school bank for Cradlerock Elementary students and staff. Selected fifth grade students will be trained as tellers and will tour the bank to learn how a local financial institution operates. Wells Fargo bank representatives also will work with school staff to develop opportunities to teach financial math skills and will provide information about career options in the banking industry.

Howard County Board of Education member Ellen Flynn Giles will join Cradlerock Elementary School Principal Jason McCoy, student tellers, and Wells Fargo Store Manager and Assistant Vice President Joseph Ford to sign the formal partnership agreement at the November 19 event.
