The HCPSS is adjusting the school year calendar by two additional days. The last day of school for students and staff will now be Friday, June 20. High school exams will take place Tuesday, June 17 through Friday, June 20. Additionally, all schools will close three hours early Wednesday, June 18 through Friday, June 20, with no Pre-K/RECC. Summer school will now begin on Wednesday, June 25 and will end as scheduled.

Five inclement weather make up days were built into the 2013-2014 school calendar. Schools were closed nine instructional days due to weather. The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) allowed school systems to request waivers of up to five instructional days from the 180-day state requirement. HCPSS applied for a waiver of four days, but modified the request to two days after MSDE denied waiver requests from several other school systems. The revised request stipulated extending the school year in June by two additional days. Today, Maryland State Superintendent of Schools Dr. Lillian Lowery approved our request.
