Howard High School student Albert Corvah was sworn in as the 2013-2014 Student Member of the Board at the July 11 meeting of the Howard County Board of Education meeting.

"I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the students of Howard County. It’s their vote that put me in office," Corvah said at his swearing in. "I promise to honor their vote of confidence by representing them to the best of my ability. I look forward to working with the members of the <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/board/">Board of Education</a> to promote the best policies of this system, as well as to learn from them how to be an effective leader in my community."

Corvah, an incoming senior, is president of the National Honor Society’s Howard High School chapter. He is a member of the school’s Leading Each Other, a group that seeks to improve school climate through community service and mentoring younger students. He was Howard’s Student Government Association junior class president. A member of the varsity football and track teams, Corvah is a past recipient of the Howard High Lions’ Pride Scholar Athlete Award and the National Achievement Scholarship.

Corvah is active in community service, leading a church group and volunteering to repair homes for impoverished families in Appalachia each summer through the Appalachian Service Project.

The Student Member attends Board of Education meetings and represents the students' voices on issues that come before the Board. The Student Member has all the rights and responsibilities of a Board member with the exception of statutory restrictions against voting on specific matters, participation in appeals or confidential personnel matters, and attendance at closed sessions relating to restricted matters.
