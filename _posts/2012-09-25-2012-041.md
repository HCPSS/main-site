Class of 2012 graduates from the HCPSS continue to earn scores on the SAT that are higher than the state and national averages.

The HCPSS Class of 2012 earned an average score of 1632 on the SAT, 165 points higher than the state of Maryland (1467) and 134 points higher than the national average (1498), according to data released by the College Board today.

HCPSS graduates also participated in the SAT at much higher rates than their peers. Approximately 81 percent of HCPSS graduates participated in the SAT exam during high school, compared to 70 percent in the state of Maryland and 52 percent nationally.

"The SAT is one of several factors that opens doors for students after they leave high school. Our 2012 results indicate that many of our students are in fact college or career ready," said HCPSS Superintendent Renee A. Foose. "Our goal is to ensure that, not just most, but all HCPSS graduates leave high school prepared."
