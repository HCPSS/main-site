Burleigh Manor Middle School 7th grader Lauren Schen was named the Maryland state winner in the Doodle 4 Google contest, with her design, "Travel to Taiwan." She is now in contention to be a national finalist.

Doodle 4 Google is an annual program that invites K-12 students nationwide to redesign the Google homepage logo. There were more than 130,000 entries in this year's contest, the theme of which was "My Best Day Everâ€¦"

Now through May 10, the public will vote on the 50 state winner designs, split into five grade groups. The student from each group with the highest-ranking design will be named a national finalist. National finalists will receive a $5,000 college scholarship. The ultimate finalist will receive a $30,000 college scholarship and a $50,000 technology grant for their school, in addition to other prizes.
