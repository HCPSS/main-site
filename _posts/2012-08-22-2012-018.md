Lisa Young, a gifted and talented resource teacher at Atholton Elementary School, was identified as one of seven finalists for state Teacher of the Year by the Maryland State Department of Education.

Young was chosen Howard County Teacher of the Year in May, joining a select cadre of 24 outstanding Maryland teachers representing each county school system. The state finalists were evaluated against a rigorous set of national criteria that include teaching philosophy, community involvement, knowledge of general education issues, and suggestions for professional and instructional improvement. Oral interviews with the seven finalists will be conducted on September 8. The Maryland Teacher of the Year, who will represent the state in the national competition, will be announced at a gala event on October 5.

Lisa Young started her teaching career in Alaska, where she became a leading advocate for use of the "<a href="http://educationnorthwest.org/traits" target="_blank">6+1 Writing Traits® <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>," providing professional development throughout her school district. After moving to Howard County in 2003, she helped to pioneer use of the <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/newlanguages/docs/6plus1.pdf" target="_blank">6+1 Writing Traits®<img alt="pdf doc icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/bullet-pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" align="bottom" border="0" /></a> model, now used in elementary and middle schools throughout the county. She continues in a leadership role in writing, gifted education and environmental programs.

Young received a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education from Towson State University and a Master of Science in Educational Studies, with certification in Gifted Education and Administration and Supervision, from Johns Hopkins University.

"Lisa is an outstanding educator who represents her school, the school system and her profession admirably," said Superintendent Renee A. Foose, who visited Young at Atholton Elementary on Tuesday to share the news and her congratulations. "We are very pleased, although not surprised, that she is among the seven finalists."

The other finalists (in alphabetical order by jurisdiction) include: Patricia DiLeonardi, Carroll County; Rhonda Holmes-Blankenship, Cecil County; Kerrie Seberg, Charles County; Bernadette Scheetz, St. Mary's County; Katie White, Talbot County; and Christina Hammer-Atkins, Washington County.<a href="http://news.hocoschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/03/news_1_082212.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-804" alt="news_1_082212" src="http://news.hocoschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/03/news_1_082212.jpg" width="300" height="213" /></a>
