<a href="http://thes.hcpss.org/" target="_blank">Thunder Hill Elementary School</a> has established new partnerships with three organizations to support student recognition and career awareness. The owners of All Time Toys, Abrakadoodle and Round House Martial Arts will speak to classes about the benefits and challenges of entrepreneurship and operating a business, and will offer encouragement and rewards to students who make responsible decisions and demonstrate positive behavior.

All Time Toys will also collaborate with educators to support and strengthen the school's Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) program, a research-based discipline system that uses incentives and rewards to motivate students to make healthy, positive choices. Abrakadoodle will work with school staff to integrate the arts with core content areas, to strengthen students' skills synthesis, analysis, reasoning, communications across multiple disciplines. Round House Martial Arts will offer team building, self-awareness, and exercise activities for school field days and staff wellness programs, and will also display student work and projects at its dojo.
