The Road to Kindergarten workshop for parents of incoming kindergarten students will help parents prepare to enter their child into the school system and get them ready for kindergarten. The workshop will be held Monday, Feb. 24 from 6:30-7:30 p.m. at Reservoir High School. This session was rescheduled from a previous date due to inclement weather.

Attendees will learn expectations for school readiness; details about the kindergarten program; information on kindergarten registration; and ways that families and children can be supported during the transition to kindergarten.

There is no registration required. Childcare will be provided at no cost for children ages 2 and older. Those needing childcare should arrive early; sign-in begins at 6:10 p.m. The workshop will begin promptly at 6:30 p.m.

Incoming kindergarten students must be five years old by Sept. 1, 2014.
