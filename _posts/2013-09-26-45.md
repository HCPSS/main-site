The U.S. Department of Education has named Folly Quarter Middle School a 2013 National Blue Ribbon School, awarded to schools that make significant progress in closing the achievement gap or whose students achieve at very high levels.

This year, 286 schools across the country are being recognized with the honor. Folly Quarter is one of only six schools in Maryland to be designated National Blue Ribbon schools. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan will formally recognize the schools in Washington, D.C., Nov. 18-19,

“The staff and students at Folly Quarter Middle School have much to celebrate,” said HCPSS Superintendent Dr. Renee A. Foose. “This national recognition shines a spotlight on the exemplary teaching and learning that goes on at Folly Quarter every day.”

“I know I speak for the entire Folly Quarter community when I say how pleased we are to have the hard work of so many persons, students, parents, and staff, recognized with this tremendous honor,” said Principal Rick Wilson. “As a faculty, we are so fortunate to work with such talented students on a daily basis and are very thrilled that Secretary Duncan has recognized their wonderful accomplishments.”
