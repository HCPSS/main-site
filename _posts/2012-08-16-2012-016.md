The HCPSS is seeking citizens to participate on various policy development/revision committees during the 2012-13 school year. A policy development/revision committee is a group of stakeholders who discuss and make recommendations to the Superintendent regarding the development or revision of an HCPSS policy. Committee members will be expected to attend approximately four to five meetings during the development/review process.

The topics include technology security; social media; prevention and control of communicable diseases; sustainability; acceptable use of technology; enrollment, residency, student assignment and admission to Pre-K and Kindergarten; wellness through nutrition and physical activity; discipline; parent, family, and community involvement.

Send letter resume and letter of interest by August 30, 2012, to Fran Albert, HCPSS, Office of Policy/Charter Schools, 10910 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City, MD 21042.
