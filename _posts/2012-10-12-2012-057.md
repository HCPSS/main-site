County Executive Ken Ulman will toss a coin on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=8800+Guilford+Road,+Columbia,+MD+21046&amp;iwloc=A&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Hammond High School <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a> football field this Saturday, October 13, to celebrate both the Homecoming game and the new synthetic turf field. The opening ceremony and ribbon cutting will begin at 11:30 a.m. on the field at 8800 Guilford Road in Columbia.

Ulman will be joined by Deputy Chief of Staff Ian Kennedy; BOE Chairman Sandra French; Board Member Cynthia Vaillancourt; Deputy Superintendent Ray Brown; Coordinator of Athletics Mike Williams; Hammond High School Principal Marcy Leonard; Centennial High School Principal Carl Perkins; Hammond High School Athletics and Activities Manager Joe Russo; and Centennial High School Athletics and Activities Manager Jean Vanderpool.

The Howard County BOE and Howard County Recreation and Parks approved a joint use agreement in May to provide for synthetic turf field construction and use at all county high schools. A new field at Howard High School will also open this fall; with ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held later in the season. Artificial turf will be installed at all other high schools over the next three to four years.
