The HCPSS is seeking individuals interested in serving on a committee to select the name for the new elementary school in Elkridge. Elementary School #41, as it is referred to in planning documents, is under construction on a site on Ducketts Lane and is scheduled to open in August 2013.

BOE policy calls for all schools to be named in terms of geographical areas of the county and for duplication of names to be avoided. Names may refer to sections of the county, appropriate street locations, established neighborhoods or community identifications.

Persons interested in serving on the School Naming Committee should contact <a href="mailto:arlene_harrison@hcpss.org">Arlene Harrison</a>, Administrative Director of Elementary Schools, at 410-313-1518 by October 15, 2012.
