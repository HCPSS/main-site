Howard school officials anticipate an enrollment of 50,932 students in the system's 74 schools, which include 40 elementary schools, 19 middle schools, 12 high schools, and three education centers - Cedar Lane School, Homewood Center and the Applications and Research Lab. The projection is an increase of nearly 450 students over last year's enrollment. Approximately 315 teachers have been hired for the new school year to fill vacated positions and new positions created to accommodate enrollment growth.
