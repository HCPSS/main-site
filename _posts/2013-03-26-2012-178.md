Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot recently visited Fulton Elementary School to present parent volunteer Lisa Schlossnagle his Golden Apple award for her work in the schools and community.

Schlossnagle is in her third year of volunteering at Fulton Elementary School. She previously volunteered at Gorman Crossing Elementary, and recently became a volunteer mentor with A-OK (Assist Our Kids). Schlossnagle also is a Fulton Elementary PTA Council delegate, representing the school's PTA at PTA Council meetings and events, and started a computer science club for young girls in her neighborhood.

This is the first year Franchot has given the award, which recognizes volunteering to benefit education in the state. The award was given to one recipient in each Maryland county.
