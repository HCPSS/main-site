The Howard County Public School System’s Food and Nutrition Service will implement a new Point of Sale (POS) System this school year. Parents will have the option of funding an online account through a credit card or online check. Students will enter their unique pin number to pay for breakfast, lunch and/or a la carte foods at school.

The program will roll out over a three-month period beginning in September in high schools, followed by middle and elementary schools. Families will receive a letter via US mail containing their student’s pin number and instructions on how to access the payment website before their school goes live. Those pin numbers will remain the same throughout the student’s time in the HCPSS. Cashiers also will be able to search by name for students at the cash register.

“We are very excited about this new online payment system,” said Mary Klatko, Director of Food and Nutrition Service. “It offers a number of benefits, including eliminating the need for students to carry cash, and the ability for parents to set spending limits and receive low-balance notifications.”

Use of the new online payment system is optional. Students will continue to have the option to pay with cash at check out.
