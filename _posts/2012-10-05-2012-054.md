Forty-seven Howard County public school students have been named National Merit Scholarship semifinalists in the 2013 competition. The semifinalists will go on to compete nationally for scholarships that will be offered in the spring. The National Merit® Scholarship Program is an academic competition for recognition and scholarships, which high school students enter by taking the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test.

"I congratulate each of the 47 students for their outstanding academic accomplishments," said Superintendent Renee A. Foose, Ed.D., at the October 2 Board meeting. "These students represent every one of our high schools," she said, adding "This is what college readiness is all about."

Of the 1.5 million entrants to the National Merit® Scholarship Competition, about a third of the 50,000 high scorers are named semifinalists, which are the highest-scoring entrants in each state. To be considered for a National Merit® Scholarship, semifinalists must advance to Finalist standing in the competition by meeting high academic standards and all other requirements.
