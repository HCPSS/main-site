The state of the art C-SPAN Campaign 2012 Bus, will be visiting Reservoir and Howard high schools (morning and afternoon respectively) on Wednesday, September 19, 2012. Tenth grade American Government students will be engaging in an educational experience to enhance thought and discussion of government, public affairs and front burner issues of the 2012 presidential campaign for the White House. The profiles of the candidates, issues, and key state races are tracked digitally. The Bus is visiting Howard County at the invitation of the Secondary Social Studies Office of the HCPSS. Its most recent stops have been the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida and the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. C-SPAN is a non-profit cable-satellite public affairs network that was created in 1979 as a public service to provide Americans access to the political process.

For more information, contact Dr. Mark Stout, Coordinator for Advanced Programs and Secondary Social Studies, HCPSS at 410-313-6622, or Arden Stara, Resource Teacher for Secondary Social Studies at 410-313-7489.
