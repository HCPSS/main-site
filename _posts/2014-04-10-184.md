The Board of Education will recognize Paul and Suzanne Haley with its Friends of Education Award today at a 3:30 p.m. reception, followed by an award presentation at the 4 p.m. Board meeting. Both events will be held at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pk., Ellicott City.

Staff at Mt. Hebron High School nominated the Haleys for their volunteer work with students, school staff, and the community, resulting in increased participation of African-American parents at MHHS, improved interaction among the school and the local African-American community, and a stronger support system for parents, school administration and students.

The Haleys volunteer with the Parents of African-American Students (PAAS) at Mt. Hebron, with Paul Haley serving in various leadership roles. Through PAAS, the Haleys encourage African-American students to take advanced level courses, and help parents navigate the school system. As a result of their work, the number of Mt. Hebron African-American students who attend four-year colleges has increased. Suzanne Haley additionally led Black History Month productions at the school from 1999-2013.

The Friends of Education Award was established in 2001 to salute exemplary volunteer contributions of time and talent that directly support academic achievement and safe learning environments for the HCPSS.

A list of previous award winners can be found on the HCPSS website at <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/board/foe.shtml">http://www.hcpss.org/board/foe.shtml</a>.
