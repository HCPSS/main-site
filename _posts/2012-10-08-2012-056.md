The partnership will be formalized with an official signing on Tuesday, October 9 at Green Valley Marketplace (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=green+valley+marketplace&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=green+valley+marketplace&amp;cid=0,0,8045088076354402229&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TyZzUJX5N-e80QH5vIGgDA&amp;ved=0CFoQ_BIwAA" target="_blank">Google map <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>), 7280 Montgomery Road in Elkridge.

The store will also support students in career exploration by participating in career days and offering internship opportunities, and will supply refreshments for school events in recognition of excellence in academics and behavior.

Green &amp; Company, Inc.; and Robert Hoffman, Green Valley Marketplace Store Manager will join Sandra French, Chairman, and Ellen Flynn Giles, Member of the Howard County BOE and school representatives to sign the formal partnership agreement.
