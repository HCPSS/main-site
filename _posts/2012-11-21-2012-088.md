The oath of office will be administered to the new members of the BOE at 4:00 p.m. on Monday December 3, 2012, in the Board Room at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=10910+Clarksville+Pike,+Ellicott+City,+MD+21042&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Department of Education <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>, 10910 Clarksville Pike in Ellicott City. The regularly scheduled Board meeting will follow.

Both the afternoon and the evening session, which convenes at 7:30 p.m., will begin with a "Public Forum," when members of the public may address the Board on any topic other than those for which a formal public hearing process exists. Advanced sign up is preferred. To sign up to speak at Public Forum, contact the Board's office at 410-313-7194.

Individuals who would like to request a sign language interpreter for any meeting of the BOE may contact Colleen Rice, Interpreter Scheduler, at 410-313-7046. A two week advanced notice is preferred.
