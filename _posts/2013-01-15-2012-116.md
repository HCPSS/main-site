High school students who participate in Career Academies located at the Applications and Research Laboratory ARL will have access to an expanded range of mentoring, tutoring and technical services provided by Sunrise Rotary members, thanks to new partnership between the school and the Sunrise Rotary Club of Ellicott City.

The partnership agreement was formalized with an official signing in December, where ARL principal Edmund Evans pledged to host at least one annual Sunrise Rotary meeting at the school each year, to allow students and staff to share information about ARL programs and accomplishments. The ARL is home to centralized Career Academies in visual communication, architecture, construction, automotive technology, health sciences, biotechnology, EMT, nursing, finance, information technology, emergency management and other fields.

The ARL will also provide Rotary with an end of academic year briefing report covering the school's performance and providing an assessment of its needs for the upcoming school year.

Sunrise Rotary will also facilitate the participation of its sister organizations in the "Howard 7," an alliance of the seven Rotary Clubs serving Howard County. The Howard 7 supports the HCPSS in multiple ways, sponsoring Interact Clubs at several high schools, facilitating Rotary Youth Leadership Award training, and encouraging participation in the annual 4-Way Speech Contest. These programs provide students additional opportunities to participate in fun, meaningful service projects while developing leadership skills and enhancing social networks. The clubs also provide dictionaries to all HCPSS third grade students.
