The Howard County Public School System is seeking one community member interested in serving on a committee charged with revising of Policy 5220, School Bus Contracts and School Bus Personnel.

This HCPSS policy establishes criteria and guidelines for awarding of school bus contracts, and performance standards for school bus contractors and personnel. The current version of the policy can be viewed at http://www.hcpss.org/board/policies/policies_5000.shtml.

Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on each committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences and perspectives and ensuring transparency at every stage of the policy development process.

If interested in participating on the committee please complete the Membership Interest Form, and email to policy@hcpss.org or mail to Trudy Grantham, Office of Policy/Charter Schools, 10910 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City, MD 21042 by July 15, 2014.
