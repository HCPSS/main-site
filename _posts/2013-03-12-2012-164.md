Teams representing the Howard County Public Schools System's Applications &amp; Research Lab (ARL), and Howard and Glenelg high schools on March 7, won top honors in the Maryland ProStart Student Invitational, a state culinary and hospitality management competition for high schools sponsored by the Restaurant Association of Maryland, and which provides more than $1 million in scholarships to students.

The HCPSS Culinary and Hotel and Restaurant Management Academies were awarded 3 of the top 6 prizes:

The first place win sends the ARL/Howard team to represent the state of Maryland in the National ProStart Invitational, April 19-21, in Baltimore. An HCPSS team has won first place seven of the nine years the competition has been held.

Glenelg teacher Kerry Johnson also received Maryland's ProStart Teacher of the Year award and will be recognized at the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation's annual Salute to Excellence in May.

The HCPSS culinary program teaches students the restaurant and food services industry from the ground up, from prepping and cooking to service and management. Students learn how to create new recipes, prepare and plate amazing dishes, all while keeping a close eye on costs, sanitation and service. Graduates are ready to start in the food services industry and head to college as culinary, baking and pastry, or hospitality majors.
