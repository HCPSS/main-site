The Howard County Public School System and Success in Style will sign a new partnership that will offer opportunities for students to practice the skills needed to gain confidence and professionalism necessary for employment. The partnership will be formalized with an official signing Tues., Feb. 25 at 8 a.m. at the Homewood Center, 10914 Clarksville Pk., Ellicott City.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, Success in Style will collaborate with HCPSS to teach students about interviewing strategies and appropriate business attire, as well as share information about its services with eligible families. Success in Style also will participate in HCPSS events, including the Homewood Center’s Dress for Success and the high school Junior Interviews. In line with the Vision 2018 strategic plan, this partnership supports social development, career readiness, and provides opportunities for students to discover and build upon their strengths.

Howard County Board of Education Chair Ellen Flynn Giles, Board Member Sandra French and school system representatives will join Success in Style Executive Director Jeannette Kendall and Outreach Coordinator Kathy Botsford to sign the formal partnership agreement at the Feb. 25 event.
