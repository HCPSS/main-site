Howard County Public School System Superintendent Dr. Renee Foose recognized the following student and staff achievements at the Board of Education meetings Oct. 10 and 22:

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Students:</span></strong>
<strong>Hammond Middle School's School Girls Unite</strong> students successfully advocated for a presidential proclamation for an International Day of the Girl. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama declared October 11th International Day of the Girl to bring attention to issues that affect girls around the world, such as gender discrimination in education and child marriage. Howard County and HCPSS have recognized the Day of the Girl since 2011. Last year, Governor O'Malley declared October 11th Maryland Day of the Girl, the first state in the nation to do so. The International Day of the Girl is also recognized globally by the United Nations.

Centennial High School senior <strong>Anusha Nathan</strong> in early October was named a recipient of the Nordstrom TEN4U Scholarship, which recognizes high school students across the country for their exceptional scholastic achievement and community involvement. She is one of only 80 students across the country to receive this scholarship.
