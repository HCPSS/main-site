Representatives of Historic Ellicott City, Inc., will donate 12 books—one for each Howard County public high school—at the May 9 Board of Education meeting at 4 p.m. Each book is a hand-bound collection of Historic Ellicott City newsletters, published from 1974 through 1988.

The newsletters chronicle the restoration and preservation activities of the time, and include articles and photographs of historical events in the district. The books will be kept in each school's media center.

Making the donation on behalf of the Board of Historic Ellicott City, Inc., are Executive Director Joyce Pope and Historic Ellicott City founders, Roland and Enalee Bounds, Herb Johl, and John Wafer.
