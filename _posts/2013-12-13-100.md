The Howard County Public School System invites county residents to take an active role in the educational process by serving on its Elementary Curricular Advisory Committee (ECAC).

Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on this committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences and perspectives to help ensure that all students are on or above grade level in reading and mathematics.

Listed below are the dates and locations for the remaining ECAC meetings for the 2013-2014 school year. All the meetings are held from 4:30–6 p.m. at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City:

- Wed., Jan. 29, 2014, Room UL-3 (Snow date, Wed., Feb. 5, UL-3)
- Wed., March 19, Room UL-3
- Wed., May 14, Room ML-2
