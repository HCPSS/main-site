The Howard County Public School System is preparing a 5-year strategic plan, and invites the community to share feedback on the proposed vision, mission, guiding principles and goals. An online feedback survey is available on the school system home page at <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/">www.hcpss.org</a>, or may be accessed directly at <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/hcpss.me/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5EYmJaYkUwYzl5Y2JaOE9qWXo3V3c6MQ">https://docs.google.com/a/hcpss.me/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5EYmJaYkUwYzl5Y2JaOE9qWXo3V3c6MQ</a>. Responses will be accepted through May 24.

More than than 2,400 stakeholders provided input on the plan at focus groups and other sessions held throughout this school year. The strategic plan will articulate goals that support the proposed new vision and mission, and outline strategies and desired outcomes for each goal. The new 5-year plan will be presented to the Board of Education on June 13 and is scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2013.
