Talbott Springs Elementary School will host a Green Apple Day of Service, a program initiated by The U.S. Green Building Council's Center for Green Schools, on September 29, 2012, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Members of the community are invited to join students and teachers to learn more about the school's "green" practices and to help construct a sensory garden.

The U.S. Green Building Council's Center for Green Schools was established to drive the transformation of all learning environments into safe, engaging, and comfortable facilities that enhance students' ability to learn and teachers' ability to teach. On the Green Apple Day of Service, advocates from around the world, including students, teachers and parents will come together in support of healthy, sustainable schools by taking action in their communities.

The Talbott Springs Elementary School project takes on the Center for Green Schools campaign "We learn here, and where we learn matters," using the Green Schools Day of Service as an opportunity to engage local residents in a greater awareness of the benefits of a "green" learning environment in a school that is nearly 40 years old and thriving.

Those interested in volunteering to help build the sensory garden can meet at the school on the morning of the event or register in advance at <a href="http://www.mygreenapple.org/" target="_blank">www.mygreenapple.org <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>.Â The school is also looking for donations of hammers, paint rollers, and paint trays.
