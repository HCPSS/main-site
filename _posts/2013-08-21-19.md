The Howard County Public School System invites citizens to take an active role by serving on the Academic Calendar Planning Committee. The application deadline is Friday, Sept. 6.

Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on this committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences and perspectives and ensuring transparency at every stage of the calendar development process.

Members of this committee attend up to eight meetings in September, October and November to discuss and make recommendations to the Superintendent regarding the HCPSS academic school calendar for 2014-2015.
