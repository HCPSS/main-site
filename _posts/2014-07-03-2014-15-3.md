For the 2014-2015 school year, the Howard County Public School System is currently seeking candidates for membership on the following policy development/revision committees.
<ul>
	<li>Policy 3030 Research Involving Employees and Students</li>
	<li>Policy 3060 Data Privacy</li>
	<li>Policy 7010 Confidentiality of Personnel Records or Files</li>
	<li>Policy 8120 Testing: State and Local Responsibilities and Protocols</li>
	<li>Policy 8200 Digital Education</li>
	<li>Policy 9050 Student Records and Confidentiality</li>
</ul>
Members of each committee attend approximately 4-5 meetings to discuss and make policy recommendations regarding educational programs and school system operations.

Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on each committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences and perspectives and ensuring transparency at every stage of the policy development process.

If interested in participating on a committee, please fill out the Membership Interest Form http://www.hcpss.org/aboutus/member_interest_form.pdf and send to policy@hcpss.org or mail to Ms. Trudy Grantham, Office of Policy/Charter Schools, 10910 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City, MD 21042 by Friday, August 8, 2014.
