Howard County is a community that values education and as a result, many Howard County community members, businesses and organizations donate their time and talents in support of public education. To recognize and show appreciation to those who have made exemplary contributions, the Howard County BOE has established the Friends of Education Award. The award was also established to increase awareness of the importance of community involvement to the school system's ability to achieve its mission.

The award recognizes individuals, businesses, or organizations for innovative or unique contribution that directly supports the school system's mission of excellence in teaching and learning, supports student achievement, and is significant in scope. Any member of the Howard County community or any group, organization, or business located in or serving Howard County may be nominated for the Friends of Education Award by any Howard County resident or members of a group, organization, association, or business located in or serving Howard County.

Completed nominations should be returned to the Administrative Secretary to the BOE at the Howard County <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=10910+Clarksville+Pike,+Ellicott+City,+MD+21042&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Department of Education <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>, 10910 Clarksville Pike, Ellicott City, 21042, by February 1, 2013.
