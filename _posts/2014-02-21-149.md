The Howard County Public School System is seeking one community member interested in serving on a committee regarding revision of Policy 9200 Student Discipline. The committee will meet in March.

Policy 9200 establishes and communicates disciplinary procedures and guidelines to staff, students, parents, and the community. The current version of the policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/board/policies/9200.pdf">http://www.hcpss.org/board/policies/9200.pdf.</a>

Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. The HCPSS invites citizens to take an active role in developing and revising school system policies as members of policy development/revision committees. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on each committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences and perspectives and ensuring transparency at every stage of the policy development process.
