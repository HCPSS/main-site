The College Board announced this week that the Howard County Public School System is one of 477 school districts nationwide selected to be a part of the 4thannual AP® District Honor Roll.

The AP District Honor Roll recognizes districts that have opened AP classroom doors to a significantly broader pool of students, while maintaining or improving the percentage of students earning scores of 3 or higher. Reaching these goals indicates that the district is successfully identifying motivated, academically prepared students of all backgrounds who are likely to benefit from rigorous AP course work.

Since 2012, HCPSS has increased the number of students participating in AP by 3.6 percentage points while improving the proportion of students earning AP exam scores of 3 or higher by 2.2 percentage points. More than 64 percent of  the graduating class of 2013 participated in at least one AP course; more than 50 percent took at least one AP exam; and more than 84 percent of those taking an exam earned a score of 3 or higher – the level accepted for college-level course credit at many colleges and universities.

“This recognition is wonderful news for our hard-working students and staff,” said HCPSS Superintendent Renee A. Foose. "It is a tribute to the outstanding work of our high school teachers and students, and reaffirms our emphasis on encouraging students to pursue rigorous coursework in high school.”

The College Board is a not-for-profit organization that helps more than seven million students prepare for a successful transition to college each year through programs and services in college readiness and college success, including the SAT® and the Advanced Placement Program®. The organization also serves the education community through research and advocacy on behalf of students, educators, and schools.
