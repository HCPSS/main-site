Superintendent Renee A. Foose presented her new five-year strategic plan for the school system, Vision 2018: Fulfilling the Promise of Preparation, during the Howard County Board of Education meeting on Thursday, June 13, 2013. The plan goes into effect on July 1, 2013.

"This plan is intended to prioritize and align all of our efforts so that every student has an educational experience that is both inspirational and empowering," said Foose. "We have so many cutting edge practices going on in our schools. This plan will help us to ensure that every student – and I mean every student – gains the experiences, skills and knowledge needed to succeed long after they leave our schools."

The document articulates a mission, guiding principles, and vision for the Howard County Public School System, and is organized into four goals that define the targeted future state in relation to students, staff, families and the community, and the organization as a whole. Specific strategies are identified under each goal area, as well as performance measures that will be used to track success over the five-year implementation period.

"The national educational landscape is rapidly changing with evolving expectations and measures for students and educators. In this uncertain environment, the strategic plan will provide a steady focus," stated Board of Education Chairman, Frank Aquino. "The Board of Education commends the community members and educators who took part in developing our shared vision. This strategic plan will serve as a roadmap to becoming world-class."
