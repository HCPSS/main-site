Since 2008 the Howard County Public School System has collaborated with the Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center to create awareness and dispel stereotypes about poverty and homelessness in Howard County. This relationship will be formalized as a partnership with an official signing on Monday, January 14, at the Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center at 6700 Freetown Road in Columbia.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, Grassroots will provide resources and activities to assist school staff in teaching students about poverty and homelessness in Howard County and the services Grassroots provides. The Center will also share opportunities for students to make a difference through community service and philanthropic programs such as Change Matters, Empty Bowls, Walk-a-Thons and other programs. Grassroots may also offer internship opportunities to highly motivated, qualified high school students interested in social welfare and services.

At 3:30 p.m.,Jeffrey Kassman, President, Board of Directors and Debra A. Popiel, Deputy Director for Administration, Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center, Inc. will join Sandra French and Ellen Flynn Giles, members of the Howard County Board of Education, and Susan Mascaro, HCPSS Chief of Staff to sign the formal partnership agreement.
