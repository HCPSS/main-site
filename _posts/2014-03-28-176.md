Girls on the Run of Central Maryland (GOTR) has partnered with the Howard County Public School System to promote self-respect, self-confidence and positive choices for girls in Grades 3-8. The partnership will be formalized with an official signing Sat., March 29 at 9 a.m. at Clarksville Elementary School, 12041 Clarksville Pike, Clarksville.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, GOTR will provide opportunities for elementary and middle school girls to participate in programs that encourage positive emotional, social and physical development through interactive lessons and running games at participating schools across the county. GOTR also will offer program scholarships and explore internship opportunities for high school students. In line with the Vision 2018 HCPSS strategic plan, this partnership supports student well-being and physical activity as part of every child’s daily routine.

Howard County Board of Education Chairman Ellen Flynn Giles and Board Member Janet Siddiqui will join Girls on the Run Executive Director Kathy Barnett and Founder/Community Outreach and Marketing Director Lisa Martin to sign the partnership agreement at the March 29 event.
