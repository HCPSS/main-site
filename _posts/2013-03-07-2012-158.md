The Howard County Public School System's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Fair was held on February 23, 2013 at Long Reach High School. Over 150 students from the county's middle and high schools participated. Numerous volunteers from the community generously donated their time and expertise to judge the students' projects.

Recognitions for outstanding student research were presented by several professional organizations including: the American Nuclear Society, the Armed Forces Communications &amp; Electronics Association of Maryland, AREVA Transnuclear Incorporated, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the MIT Club of Washington D.C., the Optical Society of America-Capital Section, and the Society of Women Engineers-Baltimore/Washington Section.

Awards for first place and runner up in nine categories at both the Middle School and High School levels were also given. The highest scoring projects at each level and in the mentored category earned the "Sweepstakes Award."  This year's recipients were Garrett Swanson, Harper's Choice Middle School, and Kristen Edwards and Meghna Manohar, Wilde Lake High School.  Jai Thakor, River Hill High School, earned the "Sweepstakes Award" in the mentored category. Ellicott Mills Middle School was recognized with the "Award of Excellence" for their outstanding efforts to engage students in scientific research.

Outstanding student efforts were also recognized with the "Dr. Lee Summerville Award" and the "Dr. Lynn Collins Award for Mathematics". Both Dr. Summerville and Dr. Collins served the students of the Howard County Public School System for many years, and trusts to support these awards were established upon their retirements as legacies to their unselfish service.
