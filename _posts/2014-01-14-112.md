The National Athletic Trainers Association recently honored all 12 of the HCPSS high schools with a Safe Sport School Award. The HCPSS is the first school system in the state of Maryland to have all its high schools win the award.

“Student safety and well-being is our highest priority,” said Superintendent Dr. Renee A. Foose. “This prestigious award demonstrates that all of our high schools go above and beyond the regulations to keep our student athletes safe.”

In order to achieve Safe Sports School status, athletic programs must meet stringent criteria:

· Create a comprehensive athletic health care administrative system
· Provide or coordinate pre-participation physical examinations
· Promote safe and appropriate practice and competition facilities
· Plan for selection, fit, function and proper maintenance of athletic equipment
· Provide a permanent, appropriately equipped area to evaluate and treat injured athletes
· Develop injury and illness prevention strategies, including protocols for environmental conditions
· Provide or facilitate injury intervention
· Create and rehearse venue-specific Emergency Action Plans
· Provide or facilitate psychosocial consultation and nutritional counseling/education
· Educate athletes and parents about the potential benefits and risks in sports as well as their responsibilities

In order to achieve Safe Sports School status, athletic programs must meet stringent criteria:
The 12 HCPSS high schools are: Atholton, Centennial, Glenelg, Hammond, Howard, Long Reach, Marriotts Ridge, Mt. Hebron, Oakland Mills, Reservoir, River Hill and Wilde Lake.
