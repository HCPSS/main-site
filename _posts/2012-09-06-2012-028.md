Considerations for school redistricting for the 2013-14 school year will be presented to the community at two public meetings. These regional meetings give the public an opportunity to learn more about the process and the plans that are being considered. This is also an opportunity for citizens to provide public feedback to staff. The same presentation will be made at each meeting.
