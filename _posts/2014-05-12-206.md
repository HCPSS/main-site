Okinawan Karate Dojo is partnering with six Howard County Public School System schools to promote wellness and healthy lifestyles among students and staff. The schools are Bryant Woods, Ducketts Lane, Veterans and Worthington Elementary Schools, and Ellicott Mills and Oakland Mills Middle Schools. The partnership will be formalized with an official signing Tuesday, May 13 at 8:30 a.m. at the Sheraton Columbia Waterside Restaurant, 10207 Wincopin Circle.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, representatives from Okinawan Karate Dojo will work with school staff to provide team building, self-awareness, and exercise activities for school field days, events and staff wellness programs. Okinawan Karate Dojo also will provide incentives for students participating in reading and math activities. In line with the Vision 2018 HCPSS strategic plan, this partnership supports the development of balanced lifestyles and staff wellness.

Principals from the participating schools will join Okinawan Karate Dojo Owner Stanley Crump to sign the formal partnership agreement at the May 13 event.
