Howard County Public School System and UMBC have announced a valuable scholarship opportunity for HCPSS students. The UMBC-Howard County Public School System Superintendent Award will be given annually to one academically talented senior from each of the 12 HCPSS high schools. The four-year award will range from $12-18 thousand per year, based on each recipient’s academic credentials.

Qualified applicants will have a cumulative high school GPA of 3.5, combined SAT reading and math score of at least 1450, and either a minimum SAT writing score of 600 or ACT composite score of 33. Recipients must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25 at UMBC, and have no more than one semester GPA fall below 3.0.

“I’m delighted about this new scholarship award, because it offers a huge opportunity for many of our talented graduates to affordably continue their education at a top-notch university.” said Superintendent Renee A. Foose. “UMBC is one of the top college choices for HCPSS graduates, and is nationally recognized both for excellent teaching and as a leading innovator in higher education.”
