The HCPSS is in the process of gathering data and stakeholder input to create a five year strategic plan that will drive the work of the school system as it strives to become world class.

<strong>Phase 1</strong> - <em>Listen &amp; Learn Forums</em>, During the months of October, November and December, Renee A. Foose, Ed.D., met with staff, students, administrators and community members to speak about system priorities, answer questions and gather stakeholder input toward the development of a strategic plan.

<strong>Phase 2</strong> - <em>Strategic Planning Focus Groups</em>, During the months of January and February, Dr. Foose has assigned a team of HCPSS staff to invite all school system stakeholders, including parents, staff, students and community members, to participate in focus groups that are centered around seven important areas:
<ul>
	<li>Teaching &amp; Learning</li>
	<li>Safe &amp; Nurturing Environment</li>
	<li>Communication</li>
	<li>Family &amp; Community Partnerships</li>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Business &amp; Organizational Practices</li>
	<li>Staffing &amp; Leadership Development</li>
</ul>
Once input has been gathered, a Strategic Planning Committee will identify common themes and develop a structure for the plan. The Committee will be comprised of a core team and seven focus teams charged with analyzing and synthesizing the data within each of the seven focus areas identified above. This structure provides for more than 100 staff members to be involved in the analysis of community input and direct development of the plan. The core team will integrate the work of each focus team into a comprehensive, coordinated strategic plan.
