A new partnership between Costco Wholesale, Columbia MD and Talbott Springs Elementary School will help students build reading skills and build support for the school among the community. The partnership will be formalized with an official signing on Tuesday, October 23 at Talbott Springs Elementary School, 9550 Basket Ring Road, in Columbia.

Under the terms of the partnership agreement, Costco Wholesale employees will volunteer as reading tutors for Talbott Springs students during after school sessions at the school. The trained volunteers will focus on phonics, decoding, reading comprehension, fluency and spelling. Pre- and post-tests will help measure student progress. The store will also support the school by donating backpacks, complete with school supplies, to students in the third, fourth, and fifth grades.

At 3:30 p.m., Tom Borg, Costco Wholesale, Columbia Store Manager, will join Ellen Flynn Giles, Member of the Howard County Board of Education; Susan Mascaro, HCPSS Chief of Staff; and Nancy Thompson, Talbott Springs Elementary School Principal, to sign the formal partnership agreement.
