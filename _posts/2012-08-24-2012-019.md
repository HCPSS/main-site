Two Howard County high school teachers are among ten state recipients of grants from the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-a-livable-future/" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>. A grant to Long Reach High School teacher Alexis Jong will underwrite a vermicomposting project that will convert cafeteria food waste into high quality compost. A grant to Oakland Mills High School teacher Barbara Savage will sponsor student trips to Sharp's at Waterford Farm and a food distribution plant, followed by design and construction of a hydroponic growing system.

CLF awarded the grants, in amounts up to $2000, to enable teachers to develop innovative, hands-on student learning projects to reinforce relationships among food, public health, diet, and the environment. The projects build upon CLF's new Teaching the Food System curriculum, developed for use by high school and college instructors in family and consumer sciences, environmental science, biology and social studies.

The Center for a Livable Future, part of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, promotes research and understanding about the complex interrelationships among diet, food production, environment and human health.
