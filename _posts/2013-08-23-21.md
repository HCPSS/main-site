The Howard County Public School System recently was awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting for its comprehensive annual financial report. This is the ninth consecutive year that HCPSS has earned the award.

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) gives the award, which is the highest honor conferred in the area of government accounting and financial reporting. To earn the award, a financial report must meet stringent criteria and demonstrate full disclosure in communicating the organizationâ€™s financial story.

An Award of Financial Reporting Achievement will be presented in October to HCPSS Director of Finance Beverly Davis, as the individual primarily responsible for preparing the financial report.

GFOA is a nonprofit professional association serving approximately 17,500 government finance professionals with offices in Chicago and Washington, D.C.
