All 73 Howard County public schools have been awarded the HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) Bronze level of distinction by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The award recognizes outstanding practices in school nutrition programs, physical education and physical activity. Howard County is the only school system in Maryland to earn this distinction for every one of its schools, and is one of just four Maryland systems with schools honored.

Sponsored by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the HUSSC is a voluntary national certification initiative for schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. It supports First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign by recognizing schools that promote nutrition and physical activity to create a healthier school environment.

Each school will receive a plaque and banner. The school names are posted on the HUSSC website at <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/HealthierUS/awardwinners.html" target="_blank">http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/HealthierUS/awardwinners.html <img alt="new webpage icon" src="http://www.hcpss.org/images/new_webpage.gif" width="11" height="10" align="bottom" border="0" /></a>.
