The Howard County Board of Education will hold a regularly scheduled meeting at 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 25, 2014 in the Board Room at the Department of Education, 10910 Clarksville Pike in Ellicott City.

<strong>During the evening session the Board of Education will adopt the FY15 Operating and Capital Budget and FY16-20 Capital Improvement Program.</strong>
