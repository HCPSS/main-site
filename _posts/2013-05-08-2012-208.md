Four Hammond High School students are Honorable Mention Winners in C-SPAN's national StudentCam 2013 documentary competition, in which middle and high school students created a 5-8 minute video on the most important issue the president should address in 2013. They will be honored on May 15 at 8:30 a.m. at Hammond High School, 8800 Guilford Rd., Columbia.

The winners, MonYi Lwin for "It's Time" and Eric Smith, Tim Baker and Bryce Rosenberg for "Set the Standard for Safe Fracking" were chosen out of a record-setting 1,893 entries from students in 44 states.

The videos can be viewed online:
