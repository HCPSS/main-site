Building stakeholder trust and confidence through open and transparent communication is a key priority for the school system. The HCPSS invites citizens to take an active role in developing and revising school system policies as members of policy development/revision committees. Community stakeholders serve a vital function on each committee by sharing diverse knowledge, experiences and perspectives and ensuring transparency at every stage of the policy development process.

Members of each committee attend approximately 4-5 meetings to discuss and make policy recommendations regarding educational programs and school system operations. Each policy committee will include one member representing the General Citizens stakeholder group.

For the 2013-2014 school year, the HCPSS is currently seeking candidates for membership on the following policy development/revision committees:
<ul>
