A science experiment designed by four Lime Kiln Middle School students that was selected to fly on the International Space Station last year will be part of the Orbital Sciences Demonstration Flight Mission, launching on September 18 from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Wallops Island, Virginia. The project, The Effect of Microgravity on Chryseobacterium Aquaticum Growth, was one of just 17 selected among 1,466 proposals submitted nationally.

The experiment consists of a "mix stick," containing up to three separate fluids. Astronauts will activate the experiment in space by breaking the stick to mix the fluids. Students will conduct the same experiment on land in order to compare results in low versus earthbound gravity.

For more information, see previous press release (<a href="http://www.hcpss.org/news/releases2013_01jan.shtml#news2012_106">http://www.hcpss.org/news/releases2013_01jan.shtml#news2012_106</a>).

The SSEP on-orbit educational research opportunity is enabled through NanoRacks, LLC, which is working in partnership with NASA under a Space Act Agreement as part of the utilization of the International Space Station as a National Laboratory.
