Ten Howard County schools will be recognized for achieving Maryland Green School status at the Howard County Green School Celebration on October 23, 2013 at the Robinson Nature Center, 6692 Cedar Lane, Columbia, MD, beginning at 4:30 p.m.

Atholton, Centennial Lane, Deep Run, Forest Ridge, Hammond, Hollifield Station, and Stevens Forest elementary schools; Glenwood Middle School, and Marriotts Ridge High School will be officially recognized as Green Schools during the celebration. The new certifications bring the total number of HCPSS Green Schools to 44, including 30 elementary, 10 middle, and 4 high schools. In addition, the Robinson Nature Center will be recognized as a Maryland Green Center.

Ken Ulman, Howard County Executive; Laura Collard, Director, Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education; Stacy Yankee, Director, Robinson Nature Center; and Ken Roey, Chief Facilities Officer for the Howard County Public School System will offer remarks during the celebration, then will be joined by County Council member Courtney Watson and Board of Education members Ellen Flynn Giles and Janet Siddiqui to present the certificates.

Green School Certification is awarded by the Maryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor Education (MAEOE) to recognize a schoolâ€™s two-year effort to meet criteria in curriculum and instruction, best management practices, and community involvement in environmental education. Each certified Green School has engaged staff and students in initiatives such as implementing schoolyard habitats for reducing erosion and providing environmental study areas, designing energy and water conservation programs, and involving community members and partners in sustaining the environment.
