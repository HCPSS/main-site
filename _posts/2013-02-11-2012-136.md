A team of ten students from Mount View Middle School took first place for their innovative invention at Maryland's First Lego League (FLL) Robotics Competition on January 19, 2013. The team, along with two other Mt. View Middle teams, and two teams from Ellicott Mills Middle, qualified for the state tournament during regional competitions.

In addition, other teams from Atholton Elementary, Burleigh Manor Middle, Harpers Choice Middle, Hammond Middle, Murray Hill Middle, Oakland Mills Middle, and Wilde Lake Middle participated in FLL regional competitions this year.

First Lego League provides students age 9-14 with a hands-on, interactive robotics program in a sports-like atmosphere. Teams of up to 10 players focus on team building, problem solving, creativity, and analytical thinking to develop solutions to the Challenge, a problem currently facing the world.

The theme of this year's Challenge was "Senior Solutions." Teams conducted research to choose and invent a solution for a a problem that affects people as they age, then presented the invention to people who could benefit. Participants also build and program an autonomous robot to perform various tasks on a playing field.
