The White House today will honor Longfellow Elementary School Media Specialist Matthew Winner as one of 12 museum and library "Champions of Change." This Champions event will focus on libraries and museums that make a difference for their neighborhoods and for our nation. The honorees are providing powerful learning experiences. They are reaching young children and their families with early learning opportunities, offering exciting experiences for teens to develop skills in science, technology, engineering and math, helping immigrants learn English and pursue citizenship and providing services for hard-to-reach populations so that everyone can succeed in school and in life.

Winner believes that school libraries play a vital role in creating lifelong learners and that gaming and game-based learning are highly effective tools in engaging and supporting the academic success of our students. Winner is the co-author of "Teaching Math with the Wii," which will be published in October 2013 by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). He is the author of the Busy Librarian blog and was recently named a 2013 Library Journal Mover &amp; Shaker in the category of Tech Leaders.

The White House created Champions of Change to feature groups of Americans — individuals, businesses and organizations — who are doing extraordinary things to empower and inspire members of their communities.
